      "<vocalsound> Um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project .\n",
      "so we're designing a new remote control and um <disfmarker>\n",
      "Um , as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly .\n",
      "Um and so there are three different stages to the design .\n",
      "So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it .\n",
      "And repeat that process three times .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it .\n",
      "My favourite animal is like <disfmarker>\n",
      "A beagle .\n",
      "Uh , right , well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family .\n",
      "And , yeah that they have lots of personality\n",
      "Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey .\n",
      "Then they're small cute and furry ,\n",
      "and I kind of like whales .\n",
      "They come in and go <vocalsound> eat everything in sight . <vocalsound>\n",
      "M my favourite animal is my own dog at home .\n",
      "Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you ,\n",
      "Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro ,\n",
      "And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price .\n",
      "but selling price is <disfmarker> is that wholesale or retail ?\n",
      "I imagine it probably is our sale actually\n",
      "because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . Um .\n",
      "I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ?\n",
      "Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones .\n",
      "um as well as uh characters ,\n",
      "um different uh keypad styles and s symbols .\n",
      "'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons .\n",
      "I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so <disfmarker>\n",
      "thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic ,\n",
      "thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or <disfmarker>\n",
      "Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost .\n",
      "Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something ,\n",
      "so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . Um .\n",
      "But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky .\n",
      "I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits .\n",
      "I I mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls .\n",
      "Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something .\n",
      "My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house .\n",
      "So um for them it was just how many devices control .\n",
      "so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses <disfmarker>\n",
      "Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know ,\n",
      "do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ?\n",
      "maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots .\n",
      "So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market ,\n",
      "So extra functionalities .\n",
      "You keep losing them .\n",
      "W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep .\n",
      "Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . S\n",
      "Maybe like a touch screen or something ?\n",
      "Or whatever would be technologically reasonable .\n",
      "Um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it\n",
      "Um for user interface , technical functions ,\n",
      "Um and uh marketing executive ,\n",
      "you'll be just thinking about what it actually <disfmarker> what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil\n",
      "Yeah , so it's th the functional design stage is next , I guess .\n",
      "are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ?\n",
      "Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ?\n",
      "I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it ,\n",
      "I think one factor would be production cost .\n",
      "Okay , we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design .\n",
      "and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder .\n",
      "Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time .\n",
      "Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment\n",
      "and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s\n",
      "Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements ,\n",
      "which is the <disfmarker> The first one <vocalsound> is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is .\n",
      "so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the <disfmarker> of the remote control .\n",
      "Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else .\n",
      "I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market .\n",
      "So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ .\n",
      "And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design .\n",
      "Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is .\n",
      "It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere .\n",
      "And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say <disfmarker>\n",
      "'Bout putting the fashion in electronics .\n",
      "I mean do they <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Is that something they want actually written on it ,\n",
      "'cause it's quite long .\n",
      "So those are the three things ,\n",
      "just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the T_V_ , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company .\n",
      "time for presentations then .\n",
      "<gap> so this is the technical functions design .\n",
      "to do the um <vocalsound> the design I have I've had a look online , I've had a look at the homepage ,\n",
      "Um I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer\n",
      "Um , having a look at the existing products , I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes ,\n",
      "there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad .\n",
      "<gap> here um the button there and there .\n",
      "That one's perg and that one's prog ,\n",
      "and it doesn't really tell you what it does .\n",
      "Um , not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example .\n",
      "Um it's a very simple one .\n",
      "It's got only the basic functions mm\n",
      "but um <vocalsound> it's the same size as the the hard to use one .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Uh it looked a bit clunky .\n",
      "They're very big and not very much use for <gap> buttons .\n",
      "and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions .\n",
      "Um , my own preferences , I prefer the the clunky one .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer ,\n",
      "So , <vocalsound> now I'd like to ask for your preferences .\n",
      "Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um , the clunky one is the one on the right .\n",
      "Um I think it's supposed to be the same size , but um it's got much fewer buttons .\n",
      "Well I think it's a valid point .\n",
      "I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated ,\n",
      "Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design ,\n",
      "you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open ,\n",
      "Um , <vocalsound> do we have any functions that um we'd want on it ?\n",
      "I mean so far I've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down .\n",
      "and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah .\n",
      "Um , you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ?\n",
      "God , I wou I would say that's required ,\n",
      "I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels ,\n",
      "uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about ,\n",
      "Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising .\n",
      "We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ?\n",
      "um we need to find out exactly what we have to have\n",
      "um and after that we can add things if they're possible .\n",
      "Um , so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and <disfmarker>\n",
      "There's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers .\n",
      "Well , one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types ,\n",
      "so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go .\n",
      "Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible .\n",
      "For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely .\n",
      "Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um ,\n",
      "things like channel and volume um are used all the time ,\n",
      "so we just have them right out on top ,\n",
      "Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls ,\n",
      "you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip .\n",
      "and then others that are concealed .\n",
      "and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that ,\n",
      "maybe like a mute button ,\n",
      "I dunno whether this is for good or for bad\n",
      "but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh <vocalsound> the things .\n",
      "what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here\n",
      "so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine ,\n",
      "Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that I've been <disfmarker>\n",
      "Mm hard to know what <disfmarker> where your role ends , yeah .\n",
      "Before I bring this up what I'll just say is um what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's <disfmarker> now becomes a collective thing .\n",
      "And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide\n",
      "So what I basically got is I just looked into some information\n",
      "and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it\n",
      "and what kind of decisions we could take away from it\n",
      "So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs ,\n",
      "and what are issues with with um existing products .\n",
      "and also about <disfmarker> try and connect that as you see with the company vision\n",
      "So this is what I've found here ,\n",
      "Um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls .\n",
      "Most people find them ugly .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well ,\n",
      "we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition .\n",
      "Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls .\n",
      "they tend to use the most simple controls\n",
      "if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know ,\n",
      "one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy .\n",
      "And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands .\n",
      "They get lost a lot ,\n",
      "Um , takes time to learn how to use them .\n",
      "and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for .\n",
      "uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition .\n",
      "Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control .\n",
      "if that's possible we might consider getting into it .\n",
      "I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be <disfmarker> wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy .\n",
      "You know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics .\n",
      "So it <disfmarker> you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know .\n",
      "my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it .\n",
      "Um I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Well , um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um <disfmarker> who's our our target audience , our target market .\n",
      "Um , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ?\n",
      "Where's the money , maybe .\n",
      "Yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend .\n",
      "it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose ,\n",
      "Um , I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people .\n",
      "'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ?\n",
      "is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ?\n",
      "Um so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish .\n",
      "Mostly focused around the twenty five age group .\n",
      "Sort of young professional , kind of . Mm-hmm\n",
      "Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ?\n",
      "It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying ,\n",
      "I think we are gonna have to narrow it down ,\n",
      "and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it .\n",
      "if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that .\n",
      "I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well\n",
      "Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young .\n",
      "So these are people who are gadgety , right ?\n",
      "So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech .\n",
      "so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition\n",
      "I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now ,\n",
      "because um , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple .\n",
      "Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use .\n",
      "Could it be an on off thing ?\n",
      "but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology ,\n",
      "rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this .\n",
      "but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first .\n",
      "um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss ,\n",
      "well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind .\n",
      "is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well .\n",
      "And also it helps in terms of people not losing this ,\n",
      "I reckon one problem with speech recognition is\n",
      "um I've actually seen one of them used\n",
      "and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing ,\n",
      "so you end up yelling at the control for hours .\n",
      "Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ?\n",
      "I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in .\n",
      "Well this is just the working design um .\n",
      "Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now ,\n",
      "but we're <disfmarker> we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like <disfmarker>\n",
      "I think back <disfmarker> in the back of our minds we know what the basics are .\n",
      "Has to change channels , has to change volume ,\n",
      "but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target .\n",
      "so I'll go into the diagram first .\n",
      "It just explains how the process goes through ,\n",
      "from the basic technology point of view ,\n",
      "the basic steps that you need\n",
      "you need some power source .\n",
      "'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going .\n",
      "Um and that power source is important\n",
      "because it ties you down to um how long the device will last .\n",
      "Like for example , voice recognition , right .\n",
      "That might be constrained because that <disfmarker> you might need to power a microphone ,\n",
      "so that's one perhaps constraint there .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface\n",
      "You know , and that um picks up an input from a user ,\n",
      "a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device ,\n",
      "Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself\n",
      "like um voice recognition , right ,\n",
      "if it's something which is important then we just add more power\n",
      "rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power .\n",
      "maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ?\n",
      "Well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ?\n",
      "Yeah , w I'm done .\n",
      "Um you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip ,\n",
      "Since we're on the topic of the technology , uh are there any like <disfmarker> what are our options ?\n",
      "Is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin\n",
      "Um , these these aren't technology options in that sense .\n",
      "a basic principles and basic components that are needed .\n",
      "So each component represents one function ,\n",
      "but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , um and the receiver , okay ,\n",
      "and the power are things that you won't have to care about .\n",
      "Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example .\n",
      "Okay , um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ?\n",
      "Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . Right .\n",
      "Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market ,\n",
      "so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface\n",
      "um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red ,\n",
      "so we could stay with tha\n",
      "Um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them .\n",
      "so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it .\n",
      "Uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment ,\n",
      "There's there's not much specific specific information ,\n",
      "In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ ,\n",
      "Um , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ?\n",
      "or should we just consider running on regular batteries ?\n",
      "Okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity ,\n",
      "and you add cost to it ,\n",
      "You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge .\n",
      "Or you need to get the user to plug it in .\n",
      "Um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller .\n",
      "then I don't think rechargeable is something we should <disfmarker> you know , we really need to care about .\n",
      "Okay , so just stick to to regular <disfmarker>\n",
      "I'm just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start ,\n",
      "was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at ,\n",
      "Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ?\n",
      "Yeah , that's good .\n",
      "Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do .\n",
      "I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible .\n",
      "Um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel .\n",
      "And is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features ,\n",
      "I think we include mute ,\n",
      "but apart from that um I think we just <disfmarker> we'll go for the simpleness .\n",
      "is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under <disfmarker> like sort of under a door or some <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , it's as optional functions .\n",
      "'Cause what what I'm <disfmarker> I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that .\n",
      "Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ?\n",
      "Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories .\n",
      "One would be audio controls ,\n",
      "one would be video controls ,\n",
      "and the other one would be a device .\n",
      "um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off .\n",
      "I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into ,\n",
      "and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic .\n",
      "Mm okay , great .\n",
      "Um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage .\n",
      "Um so uh I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next <disfmarker> well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway ,\n",
      "um for uh our Industrial Designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept .\n",
      "Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface ,\n",
      "and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching .\n",
      "Um and you'll all get specific instructions as well .\n",
      "shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed ,\n",
      "where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this .\n",
      "Yeah , yeah I think that's definitely a good idea .\n",
      "Device is basically anything which we can't categorise , right .\n",
      "so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume <disfmarker> hi\n",
      "And then video is anything that you can see .\n",
      "Okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that ,\n",
      "And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard\n",
      "Um so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good ,\n",
      "Um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe .\n",
      "Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold ,\n",
      "I'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting .\n",
      "decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five ,\n",
      "and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered ,\n",
      "that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um <vocalsound> .\n",
      "And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the T_V_ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan .\n",
      "Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product .\n",
      "Uh basically what I wanna do here , before we get into it uh too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful .\n",
      "Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay ,\n",
      "and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy .\n",
      "Number two was that it be innovative .\n",
      "Uh and third priority uh for ease of use ,\n",
      "is that I think um <vocalsound> what we should think about is how the um <vocalsound> about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it .\n",
      "Uh top European fashion trend um <vocalsound> that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay ,\n",
      "especially in clothes and furniture .\n",
      "So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend ,\n",
      "And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy\n",
      "and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle ,\n",
      "And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um\n",
      "softness in materials , shape , and function ,\n",
      "so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod\n",
      "and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of\n",
      "we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all ,\n",
      "uh sorta like a marketing identity .\n",
      "Like um the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that ,\n",
      "Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something\n",
      "or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like\n",
      "covers or something so .\n",
      "Um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there ,\n",
      "um so I've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um <disfmarker>\n",
      "we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons ,\n",
      "um the shape of the control ,\n",
      "and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control .\n",
      "Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them .\n",
      "Um they're not very attractive to look at ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> and they're not very comfortable to hold ,\n",
      "and they're very easily lost .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme .\n",
      "Um for instance , the stand-by button isn't always red ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> The buttons should be large .\n",
      "They should be easy to press , very comfortable .\n",
      "so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing .\n",
      "Um should avoid s things like that .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think it's yellow\n",
      "any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um if we did decide to go for voice activation <vocalsound> there sh should always be a button as alternative ,\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> we should definitely avoid the big square block look .\n",
      "<vocalsound> and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question .\n",
      "So it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take\n",
      "Um I don't know where the slogan should go ,\n",
      "or really what the slogan is .\n",
      "I think it's um , fashion into electronics .\n",
      "And we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is .\n",
      "Um like you said time to market was a problem ,\n",
      "um and how many components are physically in there in cost .\n",
      "And the power is basically a factor of that .\n",
      "Um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device ,\n",
      "So I guess three things , um cost , um complexity , and the size .\n",
      "um I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are .\n",
      "Um it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen .\n",
      "I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that .\n",
      "Okay so your basic components are buttons ,\n",
      "okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel ,\n",
      "okay there's an L_C_D_ display ,\n",
      "Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks .\n",
      "It can actually be flat or it can be curved ,\n",
      "um and then the different types of materials that you can use ,\n",
      "um I don't think you can use them in a combination ,\n",
      "Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine ,\n",
      "but plastic , rubber , and wood ,\n",
      "Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use ,\n",
      "but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing ,\n",
      "but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one .\n",
      "Um and the other components are logic chips , um again I'll I'll go back to the component chips .\n",
      "The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit\n",
      "Um I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size .\n",
      "Power consumption should be about the same .\n",
      "um and the other thing is um the power options .\n",
      "Um the first one is a standard battery .\n",
      "Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing ,\n",
      "it's a wind-up <vocalsound> you know , a crank <vocalsound> .\n",
      "I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources .\n",
      "I think whatever it is you still need a battery\n",
      "Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell ,\n",
      "Um and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one\n",
      "you have <disfmarker> you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes ,\n",
      "you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber .\n",
      "I guess that's more in the sense of <disfmarker> small and slim in terms of comfortable\n",
      "not so small you can't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone .\n",
      "um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit .\n",
      "Um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it <disfmarker> um so .\n",
      "The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the L_C_D_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um the case <disfmarker> okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels .\n",
      "titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square .\n",
      "Okay um there's no restriction on the plastic , and\n",
      "on the wood .\n",
      "Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ?\n",
      "Um I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power ,\n",
      "and the L_C_D_ is a form of a light\n",
      "Well m I'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a D_V_D_ and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this ,\n",
      "and uh y you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up or something .\n",
      "Like a phone yeah , like the backlight in a phone .\n",
      "We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days .\n",
      "Um that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch\n",
      "But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ?\n",
      "um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> I think we could go for like um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape .\n",
      "Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit .\n",
      "Um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand .\n",
      "So something quite curvy ?\n",
      "about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much .\n",
      "Um and when the corporate colour is yellow ,\n",
      "I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow\n",
      "So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize .\n",
      "Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the <disfmarker> on the um <vocalsound> the colour ,\n",
      "'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well <disfmarker> you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones ,\n",
      "and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside ,\n",
      "and it kinda feels <disfmarker> it feels kind of warmer to the touch .\n",
      "It feels a bit more comfortable ,\n",
      "and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber\n",
      "into it .\n",
      "I'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape .\n",
      "Um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need .\n",
      "So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this <gap> here , had a sorta background yellow ,\n",
      "and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons .\n",
      "The fact that it talks to you , I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something ,\n",
      "I think that'd probably scare me .\n",
      "also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an L_C_D_ display , where would we put that ?\n",
      "Would we put that on the inside or <disfmarker>\n",
      "Do we need an L_C_D_ display ?\n",
      "It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would've thought .\n",
      "what would we what would we achieve from it ?\n",
      "And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings .\n",
      "So as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is .\n",
      "I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it ,\n",
      "I would say no need for a talk-back .\n",
      "um I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman ,\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> well I think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside .\n",
      "Where would you physically position the buttons ?\n",
      "Um energy what <disfmarker> do you think that's suggesting we're <disfmarker> how we're powering the thing ?\n",
      "I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power ,\n",
      "And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small .\n",
      "I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons\n",
      "um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame ,\n",
      "it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there .\n",
      "Okay so so backlighting , that would be good .\n",
      "Um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable ,\n",
      "S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it .\n",
      "Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse .\n",
      "but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky .\n",
      "Um and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity ,\n",
      "and so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled ,\n",
      "'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do .\n",
      "Could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ?\n",
      "The question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ?\n",
      "'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it ,\n",
      "whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally .\n",
      "Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot .\n",
      "Um it might work for volume ,\n",
      "and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that ,\n",
      "but not for channels right .\n",
      "And the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ?\n",
      "and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side ,\n",
      "That that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in .\n",
      "the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes ,\n",
      "uh I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that .\n",
      "Yeah I think the jog dial ,\n",
      "what if it was flat and you just spun it ,\n",
      "a slide , because then you you don't have to put the hand .\n",
      "and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard .\n",
      "and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand .\n",
      "Feel like fruit .\n",
      "Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting .\n",
      "Um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product .\n",
      "And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control ,\n",
      "um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report .\n",
      "we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display , no need for talk-back ,\n",
      "it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons ,\n",
      "maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing ,\n",
      "um hopefully a jog-dial ,\n",
      "and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well .\n",
      "Um , there are a few changes we've made .\n",
      "Um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside ,\n",
      "this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , um just a a very very basic one ,\n",
      "very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm\n",
      "Uh , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time .\n",
      "the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use .\n",
      "Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ?\n",
      "The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing .\n",
      "If you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say <disfmarker>\n",
      "It might even be one , a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions .\n",
      "That's a number pad .\n",
      "Where are we gonna have the slogan ?\n",
      "just like right inside there .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Well <vocalsound> we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger\n",
      "so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand . <gap>\n",
      "So we're talking about ten centimetres .\n",
      "uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours .\n",
      "We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button .\n",
      "this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh <disfmarker> it can be the power button\n",
      "if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal .\n",
      "Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen\n",
      "Oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "be about th three and a half .\n",
      "what else can you do ?\n",
      "Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons .\n",
      "but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume .\n",
      "And what else do you do with the jog-dial ?\n",
      "Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and <disfmarker>\n",
      "Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them .\n",
      "Audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range .\n",
      "left-right balance ,\n",
      "um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes ,\n",
      "We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing ,\n",
      "and see if we need to\n",
      "um if we need to rethink anything at all .\n",
      "for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ?\n",
      "Do we have kinetic as well ?\n",
      "And that's because of cost restraints is it ?\n",
      "We need an advanced chip I think , yep .\n",
      "So we want double-curved ?\n",
      "I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber .\n",
      "um and we wanted special colours didn't we ?\n",
      "For the case itself , one colour . It's one special colour .\n",
      "We've got push buttons as well .\n",
      "Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one .\n",
      "So we're w w quite far over .\n",
      "something's gonna have to go .\n",
      "Um we're at sixteen point eight and <disfmarker>\n",
      "The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together ,\n",
      "so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond ,\n",
      "It <disfmarker> It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel .\n",
      "or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons .\n",
      "No can do .\n",
      "Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons ,\n",
      "And now we're under budget .\n",
      "No .\n",
      "sort of <vocalsound> deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat .\n",
      "width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something ?\n",
      "How how tall do you envisage it being ?\n",
      "About two centimetres , okay .\n",
      "Maybe closer to three even or two and a half .\n",
      "Okay we'll s we'll say two point five .\n",
      "but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid ,\n",
      "I think that's something that's very hard to catch ,\n",
      "so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something .\n",
      "What about button shape ?\n",
      "Square buttons ?\n",
      "discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points ,\n",
      "Maybe we should do the design evaluation first .\n",
      "I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning ,\n",
      "and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan ,\n",
      "So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had ,\n",
      "uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low ,\n",
      "and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this ,\n",
      "So the first one uh , stylish look and feel .\n",
      "I rate that pretty highly .\n",
      "Okay let's go with five then .\n",
      "Fi oh uh just actually the opposite .\n",
      "Let's go with two point five then .\n",
      "high tech innovation .\n",
      "so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted ,\n",
      "but jog-dial\n",
      "Yeah about three , okay .\n",
      "Style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design .\n",
      "Okay , the blue the blue colours and <disfmarker> don't re don't actually represent the colour ,\n",
      "the the yellow is more representative of the colour ,\n",
      "so we'll go two .\n",
      "and um design is simple to use , simple in features .\n",
      "I mean I'd give that nearly a one .\n",
      "Um , <vocalsound> soft and spongy , have we achieved that ?\n",
      "We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price .\n",
      "Yeah I think it's about five .\n",
      "logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ?\n",
      "And um it's within budget , yep .\n",
      "out of forty nine with with zero being the highest .\n",
      "We are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five .\n",
      "So it's pretty good .\n",
      "I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals .\n",
      "It's not something I need to p push through ,\n",
      "but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um <disfmarker>\n",
      "uh well next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation .\n",
      "Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and <vocalsound>\n",
      "Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ?\n",
      "Yeah , yeah\n",
      "it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know .\n",
      "But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room .\n",
      "answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity\n",
      "We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds ,\n",
      "so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual <disfmarker>\n",
      "The constraints do come in very fast .\n",
      "it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money .\n",
      "I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings ,\n",
      "and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts <disfmarker>\n",
      "it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate .\n",
      "and and the time the time given also restricts <disfmarker>\n",
      "In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your <disfmarker> the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a <vocalsound> quite a con confining framework to work within .\n",
      "And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so <disfmarker>\n",
      "But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know .\n",
      "So you think maybe a little too controlling or <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt .\n",
      "I think the interactions are very structured .\n",
      "I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it ,\n",
      "uh what about teamwork ?\n",
      "Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting .\n",
      "If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier .\n",
      "I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word .\n",
      "I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork\n",
      "because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation\n",
      "I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time ,\n",
      "maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text .\n",
      "I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype\n",
      "and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss\n",
      "and in a way everybody's <disfmarker> as we discuss things in the <disfmarker> in theoretically and out of our notebooks ,\n",
      "we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds .\n",
      "I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard ,\n",
      "and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think .\n",
      "And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually <disfmarker> it could have , we could have gone through it <gap> verbally ,\n",
      "What about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ?\n",
      "Oh they're a bit clunky .\n",
      "Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well ,\n",
      "But I think the pen is v is very intuitive ,\n",
      "So I think the pen's good .\n",
      "And o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files .\n",
      "We only actually needed one computer .\n",
      "And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , you know ,\n",
      ", the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other .\n",
      "well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team .\n",
      "I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on\n",
      "I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room ,\n",
      "and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c\n",
      "And we have Ninja Homer .\n",
      "Well apparently now I write the final report .\n",
      "I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber ,\n",
      "Oh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful .\n",
      "It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative .\n",
      "Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else .\n",
      "Yep .\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "It becomes tangible .\n",
      "Uh , making a profit of fifty million Euros . <vocalsound>\n",
      "so twenty five .\n",
      "So , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things\n",
      "Yeah the universal ones . Yeah .\n",
      "So presumably that might be an idea to put into .\n",
      "But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . For sure .\n",
      "my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black .\n",
      "so maybe we could think about colour ?\n",
      "Um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick ,\n",
      "so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle ,\n",
      "being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product\n",
      "like what is the competition in the market ?\n",
      "What speciality other remote controls are having\n",
      "They really want to have something good , having a good design in their hands ,\n",
      "What do we think a good size would be for this ? <gap>\n",
      "Kind of um , maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of , just hand held ,\n",
      "So you do the looking around at other remote controls .\n",
      "and you could look into um <vocalsound> basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one , how <disfmarker> what sort of materials are available to you whatever .\n",
      "So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ?\n",
      "Shapes and colours and <disfmarker> um basically how to make it attractive .\n",
      "well w what I didn't actually realise it was that the uh <vocalsound> this is for a specific television .\n",
      "So the all in one idea goes out the window .\n",
      "now , it was function F_ eight .\n",
      "<vocalsound> f oh sorry F_ eight .\n",
      "<gap> and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at a time .\n",
      "Uh , yes , I have to look at the uh market potential for this product ,\n",
      "Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey .\n",
      "Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly .\n",
      "uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers .\n",
      "Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also .\n",
      "but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated .\n",
      "Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons ,\n",
      "Oh you wanna go back ? Just escape .\n",
      "If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control .\n",
      "because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five ,\n",
      "They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control .\n",
      "Yeah . No signal .\n",
      "Computer adjusting , yeah .\n",
      "Um , F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing .\n",
      "uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user\n",
      "I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics ,\n",
      "the basic <disfmarker> that was the basic function to send messages to the television set .\n",
      "but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones .\n",
      "These are two leading um remote controls at the moment .\n",
      "I mean this one's got loads of buttons ,\n",
      "Um , personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use ,\n",
      "it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff ,\n",
      "Um , well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important , um\n",
      "And um I thought not too edgy and like a box ,\n",
      "so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks .\n",
      "was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark\n",
      "Easy finder with the a whistle function or something ,\n",
      "or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries .\n",
      "and uh I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ?\n",
      "is that a function we want in the remote ?\n",
      "you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? <gap> . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um , shouting , you know ,\n",
      "uh and then , what would the response be ? It beeps back at you or something ?\n",
      "So I plug it in , press F_ five ?\n",
      "Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing .\n",
      "and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others .\n",
      "And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote ,\n",
      "there could be a little microphone on it ,\n",
      "and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort .\n",
      "But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you .\n",
      "and then as for the user interface it should be trendy ,\n",
      "right , so more low tech and not too many buttons .\n",
      "So I think I I missed the budget thing ,\n",
      "it was fifty million Euros ?\n",
      "so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time .\n",
      "Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing ,\n",
      "cheap plastic uh , you know ,\n",
      "An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries <vocalsound>\n",
      "Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ?\n",
      "Or a little base station or something , <gap> .\n",
      "Yeah , yeah , we could do that too .\n",
      "uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons ,\n",
      "but since we're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power\n",
      "Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about .\n",
      "Um so here's you know , a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me .\n",
      "uh personal preferences , I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory ,\n",
      "just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting .\n",
      "And the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort\n",
      "and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles .\n",
      "Right , also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting ,\n",
      "We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway .\n",
      "Um it's only for the television ,\n",
      "and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design .\n",
      "Um , everything , all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow .\n",
      "And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have .\n",
      "speech recognition potentially ,\n",
      "flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface um\n",
      "we also want to limit the number of buttons\n",
      "<vocalsound> Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that ,\n",
      "Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display .\n",
      "Um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ?\n",
      "But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control ,\n",
      "I know of no products um that use speech recognition well .\n",
      "but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal\n",
      "um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep .\n",
      "You just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for ,\n",
      "you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing .\n",
      "we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially ,\n",
      "and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness .\n",
      "there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or uh get damaged .\n",
      "So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have .\n",
      "Um I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a\n",
      "Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_ , it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits .\n",
      "so we'll go with speech recognition , yeah ?\n",
      "Um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design .\n",
      "Glow in dark .\n",
      "if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick .\n",
      "And also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . <vocalsound>\n",
      "getting strings of um information ,\n",
      "I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> What I thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material ,\n",
      "Um , a bit more <vocalsound> durable and that can also be ergonomic\n",
      "So <vocalsound> we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care .\n",
      "And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the <disfmarker>\n",
      "We put the fashion in electronics\n",
      "Okay , that felt a bit more like a <disfmarker> something with order and and reason to it than the last one .\n",
      "Oh , everybody needs k questionnaire .\n",
      "mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time .\n",
      "Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching ,\n",
      "We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market ,\n",
      "when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good ,\n",
      "rather than having a functional look and feel uh good .\n",
      "The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative .\n",
      "And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use ,\n",
      "and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something .\n",
      "When we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh <disfmarker> our recent fashion update shows that <disfmarker>\n",
      "because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , <gap> and everything with fruits and vegetables ,\n",
      "the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look .\n",
      "Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ?\n",
      "The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co\n",
      "okay , so the interface concept um .\n",
      "Um so the method , we looked at existing designs ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface ,\n",
      "Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing .\n",
      "but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons\n",
      "And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you .\n",
      "There's um an L_C_D_ thing ,\n",
      "I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us .\n",
      "This one is <disfmarker> got a kind of scroll like a mouse ,\n",
      "Um and <disfmarker> But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that ,\n",
      "But the one below that has got like <vocalsound> a little scroll function on the side .\n",
      "But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen .\n",
      "Again that's just quite boring shape , grey ,\n",
      "looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one .\n",
      "Um this one I thought was really cool .\n",
      "It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about .\n",
      "and it's quite an organic shape\n",
      "Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um <vocalsound> , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing .\n",
      "So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever .\n",
      "And this one , the over-sized one ,\n",
      "I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky .\n",
      "I like <vocalsound> some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything ,\n",
      "and I've just got <vocalsound> an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in .\n",
      "I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good .\n",
      "you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that ,\n",
      "the raised symbols I thought were good ,\n",
      "the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget ,\n",
      "'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition ,\n",
      "But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more ,\n",
      "It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know .\n",
      "I'm not sure if the <disfmarker> if <vocalsound> for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , <gap> .\n",
      "Although , th I mean to be to be sure they have got <disfmarker> I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now ,\n",
      "And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ .\n",
      "It's a it's great , it's a good idea ,\n",
      "but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think .\n",
      "Child-friendly , I thought this was good ,\n",
      "we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think .\n",
      "Well , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s <vocalsound>\n",
      "I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff .\n",
      "I like I like the colourful buttons as well .\n",
      "And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea ,\n",
      "I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among ,\n",
      "and I'll I'll give you the uh , <vocalsound> I guess , technical considerations for those .\n",
      "And I'm gonna use the whiteboard ,\n",
      "just 'cause we haven't used it <vocalsound> .\n",
      "the way I'm gonna do this <vocalsound> is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work ,\n",
      "and then we'll throw in our new innovations um <vocalsound>\n",
      "Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside ,\n",
      "and there's a a chip , a processor ,\n",
      "the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons ,\n",
      "Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier ,\n",
      "which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps ,\n",
      "and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light ,\n",
      "Um . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing ,\n",
      "which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be ,\n",
      "processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had ,\n",
      "Um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team\n",
      "uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot ,\n",
      "um latex , double-curved , curved .\n",
      "Well , I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it ,\n",
      "And that would k also give it kinda durability\n",
      "and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast .\n",
      "so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic <disfmarker> initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ?\n",
      "I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think ,\n",
      "w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours\n",
      "So multi-coloured buttons .\n",
      "or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well .\n",
      "I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use ,\n",
      "Like uh <vocalsound> an hour glass kind of figure ,\n",
      "Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control ,\n",
      "Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . Yeah . <vocalsound>\n",
      "How would you point it ?\n",
      "We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end .\n",
      "<gap> y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea .\n",
      "it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape .\n",
      "So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable\n",
      "Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ?\n",
      "you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want .\n",
      "There's a good man . There's a good idea .\n",
      "Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "Uh speech recognition , I think ,\n",
      "uh I could put the microphone here . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ?\n",
      "So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or <disfmarker>\n",
      "What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ?\n",
      "I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ?\n",
      "do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple .\n",
      "But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close .\n",
      "we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes ,\n",
      "different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece .\n",
      "button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side .\n",
      "So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape .\n",
      "s I guess we decided on material ,\n",
      "So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel ,\n",
      "Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing ,\n",
      "and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a <disfmarker> too much of a gimmick ,\n",
      "but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that ,\n",
      "because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know .\n",
      "So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different\n",
      "I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour ,\n",
      "So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries ,\n",
      "We can use a hand-dynamo .\n",
      "So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power .\n",
      "But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ?\n",
      "It does leave them with an obligation to <disfmarker>\n",
      "Uh there's solar power . Um .\n",
      "Uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea ,\n",
      "I think we should <disfmarker> a rechargeable <vocalsound> battery will be a good idea .\n",
      "having a rechargeable stand ,\n",
      "so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as <disfmarker> uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition .\n",
      "and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping .\n",
      "I just dele I just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to say next .\n",
      "uh our next meeting's in half an hour\n",
      "and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches .\n",
      "Okay . Save everything to the shared documents , is that right ?\n",
      "You have to keep your pen separate , because I used your pen .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I wonder if they mean like literally make it , sort of buttons and everything .\n",
      "Or we are going to discuss something ?\n",
      "Uh no , I think that's us our discussion over\n",
      "Um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute ,\n",
      "There we go . Warning , finish meeting now .\n",
      "Uh oh I've forgotten to mail you the minutes ,\n",
      "but I will do .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> Will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news ?\n",
      "Okay , have you got a presentation to make ?\n",
      "No , not mine yet .\n",
      "We made three for you .\n",
      "Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato\n",
      "so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one ,\n",
      "or as mm few buttons as possible ,\n",
      "mainly speak recognition .\n",
      "If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Well I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it .\n",
      "but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand .\n",
      "Um the black on the back is the slogan .\n",
      "but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle .\n",
      "These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down .\n",
      "it does actually feel quite ergonomic ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um , obviously I don't think that's real sized <gap> .\n",
      "It would have to be a bit bigger .\n",
      "Um that's a speaker at the top ,\n",
      "Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom .\n",
      "And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one .\n",
      "and and um we have the banana-based one too .\n",
      "This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences .\n",
      "Well , nice to have uh options at least .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So are there any um improvements or issues or <disfmarker> <vocalsound>\n",
      "Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance .\n",
      "Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria .\n",
      "the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So basically , um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened .\n",
      "Doesn't save us quite as much .\n",
      "W why is the uh double curved two of them ?\n",
      "Oh , good point .\n",
      "I think it means double curved as in um\n",
      "like uh <gap> a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward .\n",
      "and why why I've got it two , I don't know ,\n",
      "But you think it should be one .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us <disfmarker>\n",
      "Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty .\n",
      "So we could even add something .\n",
      "Ah yeah , we could add things .\n",
      "Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to .\n",
      "Project process , how do we think that went ?\n",
      "Yeah I think we have a a winning product .\n",
      "Uh room for creativity , were we happy with that ?\n",
      "W I think we were very creative .\n",
      "Leadership ,\n",
      "Great leadership . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Uh teamwork . I thought went well .\n",
      "Yeah , everyone got enough input , I think .\n",
      "<vocalsound> These pens are are neat though .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Yeah , these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that .\n",
      "So just general thumbs up for all of us then .\n",
      "Uh Brian , have you have you finished ?\n",
      "At last mine is also the presentation .\n",
      "Oh , you got a presentation ,\n",
      "we forgot to mention\n",
      "it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we've got .\n",
      "So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product .\n",
      "whether it meets our standards or not .\n",
      "w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything .\n",
      "We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product .\n",
      "Then trends , whether it is as <gap> fashion trends or not ?\n",
      "Then marketing strategy of the company .\n",
      "Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale .\n",
      "what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ?\n",
      "It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Seven is good , yeah , isn't it ?\n",
      "True or false ?\n",
      "Uh one is <disfmarker> means highest ranking ,\n",
      "So it's one for from your point of view .\n",
      "I'm gonna give it a two .\n",
      "Oh , I'll go for a one . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Uh for me personally it is everything fine ,\n",
      "but there is one thing which limits the customers ,\n",
      "like we are having only two , three designs ,\n",
      "But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him .\n",
      "So we are showing our preference for particular fruits ,\n",
      "Is that no is that not trends ?\n",
      "because whatever companies <disfmarker> they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes ,\n",
      "But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um <disfmarker> you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates .\n",
      "we are doing a very wrong thing .\n",
      "We're gonna average them ?\n",
      "I have taken it very wrongly .\n",
      "About one point f one point eight .\n",
      "Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um ,\n",
      "well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know ,\n",
      "so I would actually give it a three .\n",
      "'Kay . As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology ,\n",
      "um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism .\n",
      "it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit ,\n",
      "Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good ,\n",
      "It is cus spongy also .\n",
      "So what about company strategy ?\n",
      "Well , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy .\n",
      "Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a <disfmarker> a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by <disfmarker>\n",
      "Uh overall we are getting two <gap> something ,\n",
      "So we can launch it . Yeah .\n",
      "'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget .\n",
      "So , this is uh first meeting of this design project .\n",
      "Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting ,\n",
      "this is the the plan for today's meeting\n",
      "is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly ,\n",
      "Then the main purpose is to <disfmarker> so that we get to know each other a little bit more .\n",
      "Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings ,\n",
      "um specifically the whiteboard over there .\n",
      "Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um\n",
      "come up with some preliminary ideas about it .\n",
      "So we've got twenty five minutes to do that ,\n",
      "What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television .\n",
      "Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly ,\n",
      "so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product .\n",
      "The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such .\n",
      "There's the functional design of the the remote control .\n",
      "the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially\n",
      "and then come together for meetings to to work on that .\n",
      "Um similarly with the conceptual design ,\n",
      "Um and then the detailed design will come after that .\n",
      "We'll pull it all together .\n",
      "I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?\n",
      "Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?\n",
      "I think it <disfmarker> th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be <disfmarker>\n",
      "we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control\n",
      "but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that\n",
      "and includes the <disfmarker> how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .\n",
      "it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?\n",
      "Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then\n",
      "Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for <vocalsound> for the project ,\n",
      "each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard ,\n",
      "and draw your favourite animal\n",
      "and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are\n",
      "and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . <vocalsound>\n",
      "So , my name's Cat\n",
      "Um this is a rabbit . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I am the Marketing Expert <vocalsound>\n",
      "I'm gonna be doing the <disfmarker> apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything <disfmarker> the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design <vocalsound>\n",
      "Um so my name is Maarika .\n",
      "I'm the Interface Designer in this project\n",
      "but I do like dogs .\n",
      "um so um in the different um <vocalsound> stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for um for <vocalsound> yeah , designing the technical functions of the um <vocalsound> um of the remote control\n",
      "uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept\n",
      "um my name is Gaurav .\n",
      "my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer ,\n",
      "so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um\n",
      "what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design ,\n",
      "I'm Jen .\n",
      "It's a gecko .\n",
      "and I'm your Project Manager for today\n",
      "and my role is basically to keep things going\n",
      "and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product .\n",
      "Okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project .\n",
      "Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each .\n",
      "Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros .\n",
      "And that's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ .\n",
      "Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target .\n",
      "Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ?\n",
      "I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have <disfmarker> w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .\n",
      "but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that <vocalsound> are out of the ordinary .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was <disfmarker> that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original\n",
      "that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .\n",
      "So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .\n",
      "So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or <disfmarker>\n",
      "Something that's a little less crowded than this ,\n",
      "like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ?\n",
      "But what do most people do ?\n",
      "They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again .\n",
      "<vocalsound> There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time ,\n",
      "It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .\n",
      "and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I mean we can think about all these little things ,\n",
      "but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life ,\n",
      "although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life ,\n",
      "Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones ,\n",
      "because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems\n",
      "A big learning curve , yeah .\n",
      "so we need to wrap it up now ,\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> we've got another meeting in thirty minutes ,\n",
      "you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace ,\n",
      "but im basically you're looking at the working design ,\n",
      "you're looking at the technical functions design ,\n",
      "and for you it's the user requirements specification ,\n",
      "Uh I'll see you in half an hour .\n",
      "now we are here at the functional design meeting .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time\n",
      "'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually .\n",
      "The agenda for the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documents folder .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> I'll act as secretary for this meeting\n",
      "and just take minutes as we go through ,\n",
      "The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time ,\n",
      "Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us .\n",
      "at the last minute ,\n",
      "then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be\n",
      "and what the functions of the remote control <disfmarker>\n",
      "You said uh targ target groups ,\n",
      "what does that mean ?\n",
      "As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to ,\n",
      "yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on\n",
      "Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we <disfmarker>\n",
      "you don't have to do it now but when <disfmarker> once you go back ,\n",
      "just so that I don't have to scribble everything down .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So n uh with uh with regard to the <vocalsound> uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um <vocalsound> a few basic uh components of the remote\n",
      "and uh <vocalsound> se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are\n",
      "Um the identification of the components ,\n",
      "uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and <vocalsound> uh from the user interface person .\n",
      "Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level\n",
      "these were the basic findings from today .\n",
      "The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email .\n",
      "as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um <vocalsound> and how the parts uh communicate with each other .\n",
      "also uh the remote control should be used only for television ,\n",
      "because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex .\n",
      "And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television .\n",
      "also the management wants that um our design should be unique\n",
      "so <vocalsound> it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control .\n",
      "there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface .\n",
      "The user interf interface communicates with the chip ,\n",
      "if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates <disfmarker> uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything .\n",
      "There is a user interface here .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip\n",
      "and the chip then generates a response\n",
      "and takes the response to an infrared terminal ,\n",
      "so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code ,\n",
      "Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating .\n",
      "whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically .\n",
      "i in my personal preferences um <vocalsound> I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible .\n",
      "This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time .\n",
      "And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um <vocalsound> uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions .\n",
      "Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs .\n",
      "'Cause that's something to consider , I guess ,\n",
      "if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price .\n",
      "we definitely need to operate within our constraints ,\n",
      "I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue <disfmarker>\n",
      "so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight .\n",
      "computer no signal .\n",
      "I don't see anything on my computer now .\n",
      "Okay , that's fine , that's good .\n",
      "So I'm going to speak about technical functions design\n",
      "uh my method was um to look at um other <vocalsound> um remote controls ,\n",
      "uh so mostly just by searching on the web\n",
      "And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities .\n",
      "Um so the findings uh were <vocalsound> um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set ,\n",
      "And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off ,\n",
      "uh then the user would like to switch the channel\n",
      "um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels ,\n",
      "or then mm <vocalsound> uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel ,\n",
      "so we would need the numbers .\n",
      "And and also the volume is very important .\n",
      "Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm <vocalsound> functionalities um in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ ,\n",
      "but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players ,\n",
      "but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design .\n",
      "So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size .\n",
      "And then it must be easy to use ,\n",
      "so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button\n",
      "and maybe the colour tends to be red or something .\n",
      "But then um other functionalities um <vocalsound> could be just <disfmarker>\n",
      "uh there could be a menu button\n",
      "and you could change things on the screen then ,\n",
      "um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um <vocalsound> done through the menu .\n",
      "the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities ,\n",
      "the answer was already no because of the last minute update .\n",
      "but if we had a a decent case for <disfmarker> that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see .\n",
      "and also it's it's um <disfmarker> other question is uh because there are so many different <disfmarker> And there are so many different things that could possibly be included\n",
      "because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever ,\n",
      "so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want .\n",
      "so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify\n",
      "or <disfmarker> I mean in <disfmarker> we can completely do away with buttons\n",
      "and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that .\n",
      "Um well , I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use ,\n",
      "I mean um what other options would you have ?\n",
      "A little screen or something ,\n",
      "but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user\n",
      "and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly ,\n",
      "not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno .\n",
      "I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons ,\n",
      "Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them .\n",
      "So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that .\n",
      "Uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display\n",
      "because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well .\n",
      "So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects\n",
      "and then they gave them a questionnaire .\n",
      "What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are ,\n",
      "Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .\n",
      "Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control .\n",
      "Um current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well ,\n",
      "Um I dunno what zapping is ,\n",
      "It's um switching between channels , sort of randomly going through .\n",
      "But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on .\n",
      "Um okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons ,\n",
      "so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control ,\n",
      "they just make it look ugly .\n",
      "Um so this is my little graph thing .\n",
      "what it shows is how much things are used relatively\n",
      "and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection .\n",
      "What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others .\n",
      "so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important ,\n",
      "and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses\n",
      "and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance , you know ,\n",
      "and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential ,\n",
      "and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> um and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control ,\n",
      "so this is what people find annoying about remote controls .\n",
      "Uh that they get lost ,\n",
      "that the uh you know , they're not intuitive\n",
      "and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury .\n",
      "you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control\n",
      "but that shows how people <disfmarker> whether they would pay more for voice recognition software .\n",
      "So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite <disfmarker> are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software ,\n",
      "whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it\n",
      "Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about ,\n",
      "but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking\n",
      "and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ .\n",
      "so these are my personal preferences .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know ,\n",
      "so something that's , you know , a bit cool .\n",
      "Um you know , functional , so it's useful , but minimalist .\n",
      "so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both ,\n",
      "Um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier\n",
      "and um , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool\n",
      "because , you know , your remote control just sits there ,\n",
      "and you could just sit it in the sunshine\n",
      "and save the environment a bit .\n",
      "Um and then like a locator ,\n",
      "so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or <disfmarker>\n",
      "Some kind of a ring ,\n",
      "Whistle and it <vocalsound> screams at you , yeah .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps ,\n",
      "So , we've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um <vocalsound> uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um <vocalsound> uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people .\n",
      "So if we need to have a target group um then uh <vocalsound> I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and uh you know , good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know , people who are comparatively elderly .\n",
      "I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control ,\n",
      "Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them ,\n",
      "Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket\n",
      "and the <disfmarker> I don't know how often they're buying televisions .\n",
      "I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and <disfmarker>\n",
      "wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was <disfmarker>\n",
      "Seventy six point three percent .\n",
      "but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income\n",
      "I mean like it is an age group to target , really , I think .\n",
      "and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people .\n",
      "but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ <vocalsound> to use its full <disfmarker>\n",
      "and be a bit strange to have a fancy <vocalsound> rome remote .\n",
      "I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really .\n",
      "but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target ,\n",
      "because actually I mean they're all still re young people .\n",
      "Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five ,\n",
      "but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition .\n",
      "Is that gonna have a <disfmarker> an implication for the technical specs ?\n",
      "but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about ,\n",
      "With um <disfmarker> but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five ,\n",
      "tha that should be relatively simple .\n",
      "y you'd maybe need a code word .\n",
      "but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine .\n",
      "but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check .\n",
      "w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons ,\n",
      "but I think this is not really the right moment yet ,\n",
      "because people are just so used to buttons\n",
      "What wh uh <vocalsound> what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control .\n",
      "If we can do with <disfmarker> away with that , our product can be really popular\n",
      "uh in the sense that uh a person can say , I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five .\n",
      "So that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great .\n",
      "Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't <vocalsound> as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it\n",
      "It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it <vocalsound> and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah .\n",
      "yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control\n",
      "No , but I I I was just defending the <vocalsound> the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance .\n",
      "So uh <vocalsound> wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ ,\n",
      "so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep ,\n",
      "so we we can probably come to know where it is .\n",
      "But if we go away with that that kind of general um <vocalsound> specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option\n",
      "um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . <vocalsound>\n",
      "What we have to do now is to go back to our little places ,\n",
      "complete our questionnaire\n",
      "and some sort of summarisation ,\n",
      "Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes ,\n",
      "and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work .\n",
      "Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder ,\n",
      "but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know .\n",
      "as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept .\n",
      "You'll be looking <vocalsound> you'll be looking at the user interface concept ,\n",
      "and you're watching trends to see how we go\n",
      "w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary .\n",
      "I sent you the agenda ,\n",
      "it was on the <disfmarker> in the project documents .\n",
      "Anyway , it's <disfmarker> the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time ,\n",
      "so we'll go round each of you in turn\n",
      "and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to .\n",
      "Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts ,\n",
      "we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching .\n",
      "so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation ,\n",
      "I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead .\n",
      "I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options\n",
      "and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require\n",
      "and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that .\n",
      "Okay , so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to <disfmarker> connect that anyway <disfmarker> brief introduction to the insides of a remote control\n",
      "If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right ,\n",
      "and this is the chip that I was talking about last time .\n",
      "This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here .\n",
      "If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here ,\n",
      "So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_\n",
      "on pressing this button I <disfmarker> a circuit completes ,\n",
      "the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here\n",
      "and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make ,\n",
      "so these are the different options that we have .\n",
      "So the batteries , I'll start with the battery , right ?\n",
      "So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our <disfmarker> uh the cells , yeah ?\n",
      "And dynamos .\n",
      "So uh I don't know if <disfmarker> even if you want to consider this ,\n",
      "So <vocalsound> the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones .\n",
      "The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking .\n",
      "But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes .\n",
      "But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something .\n",
      "And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also <vocalsound> made by the company .\n",
      "Environment friendly .\n",
      "There are different cases that can be provided .\n",
      "They can be <disfmarker> basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat ,\n",
      "they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat ,\n",
      "and they can be curved with <disfmarker> on both the sides .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , yeah ,\n",
      "uh there were different kind of supplements available ,\n",
      "um like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ?\n",
      "so uh we can use even um <vocalsound> a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh <vocalsound> uh some space design equipment ,\n",
      "so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company ,\n",
      "but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface .\n",
      "the interface options now .\n",
      "<vocalsound> we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do\n",
      "Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing .\n",
      "we can have L_C_D_s .\n",
      "so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive , so we can put put in uh whatever we want ,\n",
      "but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one\n",
      "or a regular\n",
      "or advanced .\n",
      "okay , so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip .\n",
      "we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender .\n",
      "besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender ,\n",
      "which is <vocalsound> <disfmarker> did not explained what i what it was ,\n",
      "So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know , as soon as you press a button , it it mm uh give gives you feedback , one five or whatever .\n",
      "I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway .\n",
      "now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um <vocalsound> uh you know , uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that ,\n",
      "Right , interface concept .\n",
      "Um to be honest actually , I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the <disfmarker> this talk um this time , I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk .\n",
      "So um yeah , this time um I might not have them on the slides but I <vocalsound> I can just mention them aw again .\n",
      "So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface\n",
      "um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um\n",
      "uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data .\n",
      "So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on .\n",
      "Um um the method I <vocalsound> employed this time was <vocalsound> a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet\n",
      "and then <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness\n",
      "and <vocalsound> also um <vocalsound> whether their appearance was was pleasant .\n",
      "this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product .\n",
      "So in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use\n",
      "and um and it's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn .\n",
      "and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found .\n",
      "so yeah , they're quite big and have many many buttons .\n",
      "Actually <vocalsound> of the <disfmarker> of all these I personally p prefer this one ,\n",
      "because it's it's the smallest and and with with least <disfmarker> uh with the smallest number of buttons as well .\n",
      "And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Our own company has developed a new in user interface\n",
      "we can uh include voice recognition\n",
      "i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it .\n",
      "Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display .\n",
      "Um s another new development is a scroll button ,\n",
      "And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed <vocalsound> a new um <vocalsound> <vocalsound> uh programmable speech uh <vocalsound>\n",
      "uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition ,\n",
      "but it's <disfmarker> once once the mm <vocalsound> um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker , there can be a um pre-programmed answer ,\n",
      "So <vocalsound> I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> uh are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ?\n",
      "the scroll button is a different thing .\n",
      "I I have a picture if you <vocalsound> <disfmarker> just a moment ,\n",
      "but I think it's just like um <vocalsound> it's it's a wheel , it's like not separate buttons .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Oh okay , the iPod thing , yeah .\n",
      "It's like it's like where you <disfmarker> you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round\n",
      "I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower ,\n",
      "Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ , then it's a lot faster than the wheel ,\n",
      "but you've got a lot less control over it .\n",
      "Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time .\n",
      "Okay , we decided to include voice recognition ,\n",
      "so to have the standard uh major buttons like on , off , um ch the channels and and then um volume\n",
      "and then the rest would be a menu on the screen .\n",
      "Um and I I also thought uh <vocalsound> if we want to keep it small and nice um\n",
      "and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button ,\n",
      "I thought it could be for for voice like , I dunno , it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something .\n",
      "Okay , straight to trends ,\n",
      "Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future .\n",
      "Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect .\n",
      "So , I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the <disfmarker>\n",
      "which I think given the target group is what you would expect , really .\n",
      "Um , you know , people want something new ,\n",
      "something technologically innovative and different ,\n",
      "so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for .\n",
      "So um <vocalsound> uh maybe uh as you're discussing things , is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here ?\n",
      "so probably voice recognition is is kind of important , right ?\n",
      "And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning <disfmarker>\n",
      "Okay , I I have a point about L_C_D_ ,\n",
      "W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback , right , to the user who's pressing buttons ,\n",
      "and the feedback can come through television itself ,\n",
      "so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> Depends how fast your television runs , really ,\n",
      "I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes\n",
      "and you put the number in the remote\n",
      "so i it actually takes quite a long time .\n",
      "so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that .\n",
      "It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen ,\n",
      "But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know ,\n",
      "like you have the slidey ones\n",
      "and you have the flippy ones\n",
      "So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know\n",
      "or like a minimalist remote control .\n",
      "So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that\n",
      "and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and ,\n",
      "So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go\n",
      "Yeah , I think so .\n",
      "because of style and <disfmarker>\n",
      "Okay , apparently , fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture .\n",
      "So I mean , I'm taking this to mean , you know , curviness .\n",
      "'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables . You know ?\n",
      "and possibly even uneven ,\n",
      "bit of asymmetry and stuff .\n",
      "But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there ,\n",
      "so you wanna <disfmarker> you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand .\n",
      ", I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy .\n",
      "Something a bit squishy and <disfmarker>\n",
      "So it could be like a rubbery <disfmarker>\n",
      "and it'd help if you drop it ,\n",
      "So if if we use uh latex cases , they won't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source\n",
      "so um we could use <vocalsound> titanium , wood or plastic uh or uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Or if we want to use the the latex , then we have to go with one of the other um power things .\n",
      "If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there ,\n",
      "So probably double curved surface is the way to go ,\n",
      "Or or curved at one end and flat on the top ,\n",
      "You have to have a certain element of flatness , I think .\n",
      "singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ?\n",
      "so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight\n",
      "and , you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing ?\n",
      "Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh\n",
      "because um <vocalsound> according to the information that I have , I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is <disfmarker> are these three .\n",
      "It does not say anything about uh whether technically , you know , this this stuff is available at all .\n",
      "Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_ , which I think is where it came from .\n",
      "But no , my research didn't tell me anything ,\n",
      "Looking at what we've got , we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel .\n",
      "hand dynamos are definitely out , right ?\n",
      "it's not <disfmarker> that's not streamlined and sexy , <vocalsound> having a having a wind up .\n",
      "kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> It's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ? You know ?\n",
      "this this thing will have to be tapped every time ,\n",
      "which which might be very frustrating for the user .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Depends how much how much movement it really needs .\n",
      "Okay , let's keep it option uh keep an option ,\n",
      "It has to be at least curved from one side , yeah .\n",
      "Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ?\n",
      "I can't imagine a m wooden remote control .\n",
      "and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more <disfmarker>\n",
      "I mean it's it's alright for a table ,\n",
      "And splinters and stuff and <disfmarker>\n",
      "You have to have some push-buttons , don't you ?\n",
      "I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them , wouldn't you ?\n",
      "if you have an L_C_D_ display , then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display .\n",
      "when we s um <vocalsound> discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control ,\n",
      "I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven .\n",
      "I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote ,\n",
      "and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T_V_ and <disfmarker> they should be able to do that and it should be accessible ,\n",
      "So I think it <vocalsound> it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing ,\n",
      "Just spinning and not scrolling , I would say .\n",
      "But I mean the the thing with this whole <disfmarker> if y you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work .\n",
      "But if you've got a <disfmarker> if if you've got a flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half .\n",
      "I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber .\n",
      "No , I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside .\n",
      "the case would be rubber and the the buttons ,\n",
      "Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it .\n",
      "Or maybe like interchangeable cases .\n",
      "but I have like a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you know , obviously my iPod's not made of rubber ,\n",
      "but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it\n",
      "and I can change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit .\n",
      "I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than <disfmarker>\n",
      "it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company ,\n",
      "so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or <disfmarker>\n",
      "That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though .\n",
      "Bananas . <vocalsound>\n",
      "but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons\n",
      "and then make the colour of the main remote <vocalsound> the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ?\n",
      "I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple\n",
      "and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it .\n",
      "Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to <disfmarker>\n",
      "<vocalsound> We need the advanced <disfmarker> yeah .\n",
      "um what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering ,\n",
      "but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes ,\n",
      "So I'll rub off the other two .\n",
      "So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or <disfmarker>\n",
      "using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean ,\n",
      "a although it does seem uh interesting .\n",
      "Yeah ,\n",
      "Uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ?\n",
      "I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in ,\n",
      "And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other .\n",
      "Flat on the top .\n",
      "Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm .\n",
      "So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery ,\n",
      "the advanced chip\n",
      "and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber\n",
      "and the buttons are also rubber .\n",
      "We're having push-buttons on the outside\n",
      "and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel ,\n",
      "and it's gonna look sort of vegetable ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> and be in bright vegetable colours .\n",
      "You've maybe got , you know <disfmarker> <vocalsound> like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel ,\n",
      "and four of the buttons are in the wheel ,\n",
      "and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel ,\n",
      "Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting .\n",
      "In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design ,\n",
      "Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design\n",
      "and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation .\n",
      "And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay\n",
      "and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach .\n",
      "And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so <disfmarker> in case we have to refer to it .\n",
      "This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting .\n",
      "what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two ,\n",
      "so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .\n",
      "It does look very cool .\n",
      "<vocalsound> then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .\n",
      "Then I need to say some st a few things about finance ,\n",
      "'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria .\n",
      "Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits .\n",
      "Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through .\n",
      "so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things\n",
      "and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and <disfmarker>\n",
      "<vocalsound> Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and <vocalsound> <disfmarker> we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .\n",
      "<vocalsound> You think bananas are a safe thing to use ?\n",
      "It's a bit um phallic .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again .\n",
      "And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that .\n",
      "And we have the user interface o in here\n",
      "and uh <vocalsound> the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside .\n",
      "And it's <disfmarker> the whole thing's made of rubber , is that <disfmarker>\n",
      "Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?\n",
      "Um it could be made a bit smaller ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder ,\n",
      "so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .\n",
      "So <vocalsound> so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the <vocalsound> on the cover we just have the very basic things .\n",
      "So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three <disfmarker>\n",
      "So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .\n",
      "And then , well this is on off button .\n",
      "and and also the colour is quite often red ,\n",
      "And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and <disfmarker>\n",
      "And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .\n",
      "The volume is is scrolling .\n",
      "On the side ,\n",
      "And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .\n",
      "and and you have the mm <vocalsound> spinning wheel with options to choose .\n",
      "Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button .\n",
      "Well , <gap> we'll have this on the screen , on the display .\n",
      "On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .\n",
      "Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options .\n",
      "yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?\n",
      "But if you hold it in ,\n",
      "if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it .\n",
      "You can't really see it in the interface .\n",
      "And it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours .\n",
      "Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website .\n",
      "I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues ,\n",
      "but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow .\n",
      "So what we're gonna do is prefer <disfmarker> prepare the evaluation of the new design .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale ,\n",
      "so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement\n",
      "and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again .\n",
      "Um , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them .\n",
      "So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven .\n",
      "I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here ,\n",
      "but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points .\n",
      "Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good .\n",
      "Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in .\n",
      "If you take a note of them ,\n",
      "Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?\n",
      "Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people ,\n",
      "so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m <vocalsound> model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .\n",
      "left-handed people can't normally write right-handed ,\n",
      "So maybe we need to put <disfmarker> that needs a little bit of investigation ,\n",
      "maybe give it a five , I would say ?\n",
      "Or maybe six ,\n",
      "It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right ,\n",
      "I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top .\n",
      "Yeah , but we <disfmarker> which makes it kind of really big , yeah .\n",
      "or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ?\n",
      "th there's the locator dot .\n",
      "Mm that you stick on T_V_ .\n",
      "so that means you need a <disfmarker> that does mean you need a little speaker on it though ,\n",
      "To make it beep .\n",
      "so that's seven , yeah .\n",
      "If <vocalsound> uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things\n",
      "I'd say six ,\n",
      "'cause the <disfmarker> I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it .\n",
      "but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to .\n",
      "but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it .\n",
      "So , should we maybe say f a five\n",
      "so possibly for left-handed . Investigate .\n",
      "But otherwise it's superb .\n",
      "So , should we give it a six ?\n",
      "Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design <disfmarker>\n",
      "well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things ,\n",
      "but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway ,\n",
      "And moreover it it has um <vocalsound> L_C_D_ and everything ,\n",
      "so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway .\n",
      "Okay , so we give that a six ,\n",
      "G_ technologically innovative .\n",
      "it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is <disfmarker> yeah , it's kind of new .\n",
      "All of the components have been used in other things before .\n",
      "They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think .\n",
      "What do you reckon , five , six ?\n",
      "Six .\n",
      "Put fashion in electronics .\n",
      "Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so .\n",
      "So I think we've done very well ,\n",
      "So , we need the average here ,\n",
      "The average is about six and something .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Six point five , yeah .\n",
      "that's pretty good , I think .\n",
      "so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria .\n",
      "And now we have to calculate the production costs .\n",
      "So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that .\n",
      "Um I started filling it in ,\n",
      "No hand dynamo , right ?\n",
      "One simple battery .\n",
      "The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print .\n",
      "We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker .\n",
      "Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it .\n",
      "Case material we said rubber .\n",
      "I don't know what special colour means .\n",
      "I think something coloured ,\n",
      "but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know .\n",
      "<vocalsound> maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different .\n",
      "Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it ,\n",
      "We have pushbuttons ,\n",
      "Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ?\n",
      "And we have L_C_ display\n",
      "And button supplements .\n",
      "Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel <disfmarker>\n",
      "We've got more than one pushbutton though ,\n",
      "That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ?\n",
      "That seems unlikely .\n",
      "whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we <disfmarker>\n",
      "We have to count all of them ,\n",
      "I don't think that makes sense .\n",
      "if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five ,\n",
      "it's a scroll wheel <disfmarker> so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display ,\n",
      "So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here .\n",
      "Our budget's twelve point five .\n",
      "Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go ,\n",
      "'cause that's the most expensive thing on there .\n",
      "so that has implications though for the <gap> .\n",
      "Uh it does not have for voice recognition ,\n",
      "but it does have for the feedback speaker .\n",
      "<gap> when you say <disfmarker> when you press one it says one or it says hello .\n",
      "But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ?\n",
      "Mm <vocalsound> and the locator also goes away .\n",
      "Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive ,\n",
      "but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps .\n",
      "A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface ,\n",
      "because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber .\n",
      "Right , so we need one fifty off .\n",
      "Take it down to just a scroll wheel .\n",
      "how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ?\n",
      "in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ?\n",
      "But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button .\n",
      "you can push this one ,\n",
      "but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .\n",
      "So that's point three .\n",
      "and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing .\n",
      "The scroll wheel is on the side .\n",
      "We're point three over at the moment .\n",
      "Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether\n",
      "and just have pushbuttons for the volume .\n",
      "Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up <disfmarker> for up and down .\n",
      "Oh look , we're way under budget\n",
      "Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve <gap> , couldn't we ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour .\n",
      "So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ?\n",
      "No , I don't think so .\n",
      "Because we keep all the features ,\n",
      "we keep voice recognition ,\n",
      "we keep L_C_D_ display .\n",
      "instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons .\n",
      "<vocalsound> But we lose the locator .\n",
      "We're gonna have a beep .\n",
      "so we still have the locate .\n",
      "It can come in the same colour as the the case .\n",
      "so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went ,\n",
      "um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product .\n",
      "as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity .\n",
      "The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had .\n",
      "I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with .\n",
      "If we'd had that sheet at the beginning <gap> should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can .\n",
      "But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of .\n",
      "I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know .\n",
      "Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used .\n",
      "the whiteboard digital pens .\n",
      "<vocalsound> We like the pens . <vocalsound>\n",
      "But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint ,\n",
      "Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the <vocalsound> <disfmarker>\n",
      "But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah .\n",
      "I mean that was fairly tight anyway ,\n",
      "I mean especially with that last-minute alteration .\n",
      "I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah .\n",
      "You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good .\n",
      "And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah .\n",
      "Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ?\n",
      "Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group ,\n",
      "so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .\n",
      "New ideas found .\n",
      "Not quite sure what about .\n",
      "Well it's it's it's pretty new ,\n",
      "I think we'd like to think the ideas were new ,\n",
      "costs are within budget ,\n",
      "One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee .\n",
      "Um we've evaluated the project .\n",
      "Can you put that in the project documents file ?\n",
      "And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with .\n",
      "And my main difficulty was the the time pressure .\n",
      "sometimes it's like a little bit rushed .\n",
      "we've got like five minutes left .\n",
      "but if we've finished , then we've finished .\n",
      "So I would say that's the end of that meeting .\n",
      "Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .\n",
      "Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .\n",
      "Was there a questionnaire already sent ?\n",
      "Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?\n",
      "I don't see why you can't stay here , really .\n",
      "So <gap> is the agenda ?\n",
      "Opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing .\n",
      "Project aim is a new remote control .\n",
      "It's original , uh trendy and it's user-friendly .\n",
      "Try out the whiteboard ,\n",
      "every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal .\n",
      "so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working .\n",
      "Okay , project finance ,\n",
      "selling price twenty five Euros ,\n",
      "profit aim fifty million Euros .\n",
      "Market range internationally sold .\n",
      "it's gotta be <disfmarker> can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make .\n",
      "Next meeting starts in thirty minutes .\n",
      "I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where .\n",
      "Yeah , I think we're <disfmarker> I mean before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for <disfmarker>\n",
      "Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or <disfmarker>\n",
      "Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ?\n",
      "Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ?\n",
      "Yeah . Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control .\n",
      "Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and <disfmarker>\n",
      "I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_\n",
      "and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that ,\n",
      "but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something .\n",
      "'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices ,\n",
      "but that would p that would probably be quite expensive .\n",
      "and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these <disfmarker> any of these ideas are feasible or not .\n",
      "So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things .\n",
      "Couldn't we have like one that comes out ?\n",
      "you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically .\n",
      "Um <gap> have uh one very complicated one on one side with <vocalsound> all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff ,\n",
      "and then on the other side o <vocalsound> one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and <vocalsound> minus , and the just the mute button , for example .\n",
      "I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though ,\n",
      "'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it .\n",
      "No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold\n",
      "or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception <disfmarker>\n",
      "Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface ,\n",
      "but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ ,\n",
      "but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate\n",
      "D_V_D_ players , things like that .\n",
      "I think we should also have a back-up plan of <disfmarker> I <disfmarker>\n",
      "'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that <disfmarker>\n",
      "We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just <disfmarker> that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one .\n",
      "have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use ,\n",
      "But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ?\n",
      "Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people\n",
      "or <disfmarker> big buttons for <disfmarker> touchy buttons for <disfmarker>\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think a flip up thing ,\n",
      "like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones ,\n",
      "User Interface Designer , that's that's\n",
      "so you gotta <gap> you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . Um .\n",
      "Industrial Designer , you are the one <gap> , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um\n",
      "Mm . Har how it works an\n",
      "And in marketing <disfmarker>\n",
      "User requirements specifications .\n",
      "Do you think our two kind of overlap , because <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap .\n",
      "You two <vocalsound> you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you <disfmarker> working together .\n",
      "You're the one that's gotta go and find out <disfmarker> do th do the research ,\n",
      "so I just wanna <disfmarker> rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that <vocalsound> wanted to know your names again .\n",
      "Okay , right , welcome to meeting B_ .\n",
      "Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically ,\n",
      "uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now .\n",
      "and , uh yeah , I'm just here to\n",
      "<gap> sort of liaise between the three of you\n",
      "and get things going , get people talking\n",
      "and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically .\n",
      "what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you ,\n",
      "We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all .\n",
      "This meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now .\n",
      "So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that .\n",
      "Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter ,\n",
      "I'm gonna draw it on the board then .\n",
      "So um <vocalsound> the idea is that we've got the\n",
      "energy source um ,\n",
      "So um I think maybe uh two batteries ,\n",
      "then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal ,\n",
      "which could be uh an infra-red signal ,\n",
      "um which will be sent by an electronic chip .\n",
      "Is a battery like the only way of <disfmarker>\n",
      "No 'cause like cha 'cause <disfmarker> always changing um um batteries can get like annoying .\n",
      "swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but <disfmarker>\n",
      "as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ?\n",
      "It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not <disfmarker> doesn't have to go that far ,\n",
      "Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .\n",
      "Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it .\n",
      "How about Bluetooth ? <gap>\n",
      "Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you <gap> you w don't wanna overcomplicate things .\n",
      "Yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there .\n",
      "I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but <disfmarker>\n",
      "Um so things that <vocalsound> seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control ,\n",
      "uh channel keys up-down ,\n",
      "but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down ,\n",
      "And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes ,\n",
      "ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred ,\n",
      "judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after ,\n",
      "So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality ,\n",
      "so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use .\n",
      "Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or <disfmarker>\n",
      "No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know .\n",
      "what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that <gap> a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?\n",
      "I would say it's <disfmarker> If it's simple to do ,\n",
      "Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred <vocalsound> well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit .\n",
      "It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .\n",
      "and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design .\n",
      "Uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know ,\n",
      "and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um .\n",
      "Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab ,\n",
      "So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly .\n",
      "Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user .\n",
      "I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it .\n",
      "and also we asked them whether they wanted <vocalsound> <disfmarker> whether they'd be interested in um <vocalsound> voice activating .\n",
      "but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .\n",
      "It's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and <disfmarker>\n",
      "most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,\n",
      "What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> Voice activation might not be the best .\n",
      "I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off .\n",
      "Um also with um with buttons , <vocalsound> a thing called R_S_I_ ,\n",
      "we should probably consult with our legal department uh .\n",
      "I'll see if I can get <disfmarker> see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting .\n",
      "I think we can do some really <disfmarker> in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements .\n",
      "we've decided that it's gonna be , you know uh , we're going for a basic television remote .\n",
      "I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything ,\n",
      "uh and that would be infra-red ,\n",
      "energy source , that would be batteries .\n",
      "Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . Um .\n",
      "oh <gap> have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other ?\n",
      "Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as <gap>\n",
      "I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background ,\n",
      "Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white <disfmarker> with yellow borders .\n",
      "Can't we have different colours in the remotes ,\n",
      "And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups ,\n",
      "so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them .\n",
      "So we have to have it one colour .\n",
      "Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable .\n",
      "but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products\n",
      "so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps .\n",
      "But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere\n",
      "And um , I think we uh stop for lunch now .\n",
      "Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> which was we got together just to basically decide on <disfmarker> well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing ,\n",
      "Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations ,\n",
      "o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery ,\n",
      "a hand dynamo which is <disfmarker> which was used uh in the fifties for torches ,\n",
      "You can have a kinetic provision of energy ,\n",
      "Or you can use solar cells ,\n",
      "but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with <disfmarker> but also using some solar power .\n",
      "Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really .\n",
      "And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one .\n",
      "You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium .\n",
      "And th for each of them you have uh cases where <disfmarker> for example titanium , you can't use it for <disfmarker> if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium .\n",
      "But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything .\n",
      "So that might be an idea of using the rubber ,\n",
      "And also it doesn't break as easily maybe ,\n",
      "Rubber , we're all we're all going <disfmarker> we're all liking that idea ?\n",
      "so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse ,\n",
      "um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display .\n",
      "Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons .\n",
      "Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double <disfmarker> rubber double curved case ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "Let's have rubber push buttons , hey .\n",
      "Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be <disfmarker>\n",
      "If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive .\n",
      "<vocalsound> is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ?\n",
      "Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red .\n",
      "If it's something that's inside the the unit . <vocalsound> I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not .\n",
      "So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print .\n",
      "What about the just developed uh sample sensor ?\n",
      "Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ?\n",
      "I'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and <disfmarker>\n",
      "it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns <disfmarker> comes on ,\n",
      "a it just gives you a verbal response .\n",
      "Oh , then <gap> forget about it .\n",
      "so we want it rub rubber double curved . <vocalsound>\n",
      "So rubber rubber keys , yeah .\n",
      "But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific <disfmarker>\n",
      "Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic .\n",
      "Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine .\n",
      "So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface .\n",
      "I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea .\n",
      "they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod .\n",
      "but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche ,\n",
      "but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well .\n",
      "I can give you an example here of uh , <gap> good layout and bad layout\n",
      "So this would be an example of bad layout ,\n",
      "where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh\n",
      "Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose .\n",
      "Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense .\n",
      "I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us .\n",
      "So we're <disfmarker> we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh .\n",
      "I think we shall have a limited number of buttons ,\n",
      "ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad .\n",
      "it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that .\n",
      "Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy ,\n",
      "Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere ,\n",
      "I I guess <vocalsound> the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before .\n",
      "Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets\n",
      "So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already <disfmarker> that we already have .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative .\n",
      "now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap .\n",
      "I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy .\n",
      "That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth ,\n",
      "'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is <vocalsound> ,\n",
      "they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not .\n",
      "Of course , they do .\n",
      "So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other\n",
      "that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does ,\n",
      "Well , if you're looking at <vocalsound> <disfmarker> if you <gap> looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art .\n",
      "Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth ,\n",
      "If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have\n",
      "Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then .\n",
      "It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet .\n",
      "Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah , this <disfmarker> that's that's very good .\n",
      "Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating <disfmarker> like the energy generator .\n",
      "Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .\n",
      "Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them .\n",
      "and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy ,\n",
      "Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there .\n",
      "right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing ,\n",
      "and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though .\n",
      "Maybe make it like fruity colours or something .\n",
      "The power button could be like a big apple or something .\n",
      "Um like I'm just thinking bright colours .\n",
      "Wanna make it different colours so <vocalsound> anybody can choo like like <gap> <disfmarker>\n",
      "so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the <disfmarker>\n",
      "where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing .\n",
      "from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design .\n",
      "Um Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know <disfmarker> come up with the the user interface design .\n",
      "Then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this .\n",
      "Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay .\n",
      "come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas .\n",
      "Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation .\n",
      "We'll look into this lock key\n",
      "We've got a cool prototype .\n",
      "everything uh that we wanted\n",
      "we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber ,\n",
      "Double curved .\n",
      "um but also something that was gonna jump out at people ,\n",
      "So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here .\n",
      "So , basically , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , <vocalsound> the thumb button is the power button .\n",
      "Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down ,\n",
      "Um and then then you can also <disfmarker> there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want .\n",
      "but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different .\n",
      "That certainly does .\n",
      "I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing ,\n",
      "but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one .\n",
      "But , that's I don't see why that's not possible .\n",
      "like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ?\n",
      "Yeah , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer <vocalsound> for the whole <disfmarker> the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse .\n",
      "I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so <disfmarker>\n",
      "But we can have both uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Have them in stock .\n",
      "I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable .\n",
      "And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue .\n",
      "One thing I do need to do <disfmarker> we need to look at , is the costs .\n",
      "I could do <disfmarker> you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you ,\n",
      "but it's just easy enough to go through it with you ,\n",
      "so we're going for the kinetic power .\n",
      "So <disfmarker> the case , we've gone for the double curved .\n",
      "and it's made out of rubber .\n",
      "well they're in diff special colours ,\n",
      "Special form ,\n",
      "We're under budget .\n",
      "That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make .\n",
      "And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty .\n",
      "so we evaluate each criteria .\n",
      "And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven ,\n",
      "one being true , so it's it's more like it's <disfmarker> fits the criteria ,\n",
      "and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria .\n",
      "So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ?\n",
      "I would give it a seven .\n",
      "As in it's not .\n",
      "Oh sorry , one , d yeah .\n",
      "Second criteria , new technology .\n",
      "Well , the kinetic thing , yeah .\n",
      "w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new .\n",
      "Maybe three , yeah .\n",
      "So criteria three is is it easy to use ?\n",
      "not if you're left-handed it's not .\n",
      "If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two .\n",
      "<vocalsound> 'Kay , criteria four is costs . <gap>\n",
      "It's come in under budget .\n",
      "So that's a definite one .\n",
      "Amount of buttons .\n",
      "Contains only the necessary buttons .\n",
      "R_S_I_ is it good against ?\n",
      "Yes . Very good .\n",
      "does it get lost ?\n",
      "I don't think it's gonna get lost easily .\n",
      "But it is smallish .\n",
      "I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but <disfmarker>\n",
      "So that's the evaluation ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> We've , we've done well .\n",
      "Number one product .\n",
      "Okay , I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it ,\n",
      "um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times ,\n",
      "and be you know , has been good communication going on . <vocalsound>\n",
      "during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion ,\n",
      "but we we kept <disfmarker> we tried to keep it cool and and\n",
      "Now you guys have been a a great team .\n",
      "and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before ,\n",
      "I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in .\n",
      "I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ?\n",
      "I think actually <disfmarker> and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know .\n",
      "Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ?\n",
      "The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ?\n",
      "I love it . <vocalsound> I love it . <vocalsound> I think it's cool .\n",
      "Um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing .\n",
      "It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not <disfmarker>\n",
      "it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text .\n",
      "I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step .\n",
      "Good morning everybody .\n",
      "Um I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting .\n",
      "My name is Rose Lindgren .\n",
      "I I'll be the Project Manager .\n",
      "Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening\n",
      "and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project ,\n",
      "then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise .\n",
      "And then we'll move into the project plan ,\n",
      "do a little discussion\n",
      "Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about ,\n",
      "it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly .\n",
      "Um so we're gonna divide us up into three <vocalsound> compa three parts .\n",
      "First the functional design\n",
      "which will be uh first we'll do individual work ,\n",
      "come into a meeting ,\n",
      "the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting ,\n",
      "and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting .\n",
      "Um we're gonna do a little tool training ,\n",
      "so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you .\n",
      "Um introduce yourself ,\n",
      "and then draw your favourite animal\n",
      "My name is Alima Bucciantini .\n",
      "and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project .\n",
      "I will draw a little turtle for you all .\n",
      "my name is Iain uh\n",
      "and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project . Um .\n",
      "It's a whale <vocalsound> , yes .\n",
      "I'm Jessy .\n",
      "Briefly , it's supposed to be a seal .\n",
      "We're gonna talk about project finances .\n",
      "we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales\n",
      "and because this is such <disfmarker> this is for television it's a <disfmarker> we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range ,\n",
      "Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro .\n",
      "just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , I could <disfmarker> I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls ,\n",
      "what would be the best um like you <disfmarker> what are the features that you really like\n",
      "Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_\n",
      "'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload .\n",
      "especially , like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of <disfmarker> in front of me , you know , one for the T_V_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . Um .\n",
      "And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing ,\n",
      "they've got too many buttons on them\n",
      "uh too too sort of too sort of complicated\n",
      "and that there's not too many buttons ,\n",
      "they are not too small ,\n",
      "like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries\n",
      "but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery\n",
      "it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes .\n",
      "doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder\n",
      "but that just has your major buttons for <disfmarker> that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off ,\n",
      "so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here ,\n",
      "then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here ,\n",
      "all the <disfmarker> whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together ,\n",
      "and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day .\n",
      "so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things .\n",
      "are we designing a remote control for a television only\n",
      "would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ?\n",
      "Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> I'll look into that .\n",
      "I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for .\n",
      "If it's just a television then that <disfmarker> it's a bit simpler ,\n",
      "If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it .\n",
      "Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes .\n",
      "Um the industrial design , Alima will be doing um the working design .\n",
      "Um the User Interface Designer , that's for <gap> . Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons .\n",
      "Um user requirements um , so you'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need ,\n",
      "And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach .\n",
      "What we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting ?\n",
      "I haven't gotten an agenda yet ,\n",
      "um I'll put that together .\n",
      "I'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction\n",
      "I'll type up mi minutes\n",
      "and probably email those out to all of you . Um just including all the things that we talked about . Um .\n",
      "Can you e-mail your slides as well ?\n",
      "Yes , I yes , I think I can .\n",
      "I'll just attach it to an email .\n",
      "Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails . <vocalsound>\n",
      "This is our functional design meeting .\n",
      "our agenda today um <disfmarker>\n",
      "Um . I'm gonna do an opening ,\n",
      "did you all get the minutes ?\n",
      "I e-mailed them to you .\n",
      "I'm also putting 'em <disfmarker> them in the shared folder .\n",
      "So um then I <disfmarker> we'll talk about our general objectives\n",
      "and have your three presentations .\n",
      "Um I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received ,\n",
      "and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions .\n",
      "Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the <gap> functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function .\n",
      "How do I hook my screen up ?\n",
      "there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there\n",
      "And then you have to press function F_ eight\n",
      "I I think you just have to push it in really hard .\n",
      "I don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online\n",
      "or if I'm the only one who is .\n",
      "we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked .\n",
      "They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab\n",
      "and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had .\n",
      "Focusing on their desires , um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly <vocalsound> ,\n",
      "seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that\n",
      "more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote .\n",
      "and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age ,\n",
      "so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition ,\n",
      "That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes .\n",
      "I think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration .\n",
      "People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote\n",
      "and I think that ties back to what you were saying before\n",
      "just that there's too many buttons ,\n",
      "It also mentioned something called R_S_I_\n",
      "and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is ,\n",
      "Repetitive strain injury .\n",
      "So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that ,\n",
      "Um looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour .\n",
      "People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote .\n",
      "People also zap like to change the channel , about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use .\n",
      "So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings ,\n",
      "the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up\n",
      "although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were ,\n",
      "also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote\n",
      "make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often .\n",
      "And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like ,\n",
      "I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um .\n",
      "We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is .\n",
      "It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television ,\n",
      "it sends a message to the television\n",
      "First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications .\n",
      "so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does ,\n",
      "and what the end-user is gonna want from this product .\n",
      "a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product ,\n",
      "um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about\n",
      "h how well these particular prototypes work ,\n",
      "When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places .\n",
      "So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design\n",
      "But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas\n",
      "Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities .\n",
      "Uh the first of these is is technological\n",
      "uh we need to find a balance between features and price .\n",
      "things like voice recognition would would add to the price\n",
      "uh but it would also im improve the design of the product .\n",
      "I had a look on the <disfmarker> on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls .\n",
      "In analysing these we can consider what what things <disfmarker> what's good about them ,\n",
      "um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found\n",
      "Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum .\n",
      "Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control ,\n",
      "so it's one that's got lots of buttons ,\n",
      "everything you might possibly want to do is there ,\n",
      "The one on the right is a lot more basic .\n",
      "It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it ,\n",
      "Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control .\n",
      "Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple ,\n",
      "uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel .\n",
      "that's ergonomically designed .\n",
      "I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool .\n",
      "did it let you go on the Internet\n",
      "Uh that was just on the d on the company web site , yeah .\n",
      "and then I'm like wait <vocalsound> it won't let me google . <vocalsound>\n",
      "this is our working design presentation .\n",
      "Um I had a bit of <disfmarker> some issues with this ,\n",
      "because I wasn't able to find everything I needed ,\n",
      "what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function .\n",
      "Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder .\n",
      "because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans\n",
      "because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work .\n",
      "So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function .\n",
      "the findings that I got uh very <disfmarker> just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver\n",
      "and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that\n",
      "Um the user interface is critical here ,\n",
      "because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls <disfmarker> that converts the electrical energy into data ,\n",
      "the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver .\n",
      "And <vocalsound> personal preferences , besides the fact that I can't spell , we need a long-lasting energy source ,\n",
      "We need a chip that works well with the user interface ,\n",
      "and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal ,\n",
      "requirements . We have a couple new requirements\n",
      "We didn't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far ,\n",
      "but we're not gonna work with teletext\n",
      "What's teletext ?\n",
      "Uh , it's a British thing .\n",
      "I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser .\n",
      "this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it .\n",
      "and it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing .\n",
      "It's earl it's pretty old technology .\n",
      "like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera . Just for television . That's what we're focused on .\n",
      "Um otherwise becomes to complex ,\n",
      "Um and finally there's more marketing , I think , um , our corporate image has to be recognisable .\n",
      "while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design .\n",
      "It's <disfmarker> It's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics .\n",
      "Looks like , yeah , kind of a yellow and black\n",
      "and we have that <disfmarker> the emphasis on the R_s in um <disfmarker>\n",
      "It's like double R_ .\n",
      "we need to talk about our functions and our target group .\n",
      "You um in your analysis of different market um <disfmarker> of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things\n",
      "if we're gonna say that function um fashion <disfmarker> we put the fashion in in electronics then you <disfmarker> automatically , I think , a sort of younger group that <disfmarker> that's <disfmarker> who's gonna be attracted to this .\n",
      "I do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ?\n",
      "at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself ,\n",
      "The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation\n",
      "so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea .\n",
      "that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway ,\n",
      "that's all specific for speech recognition .\n",
      "Are we gonna use that as one of our functions ?\n",
      "I I would say no ,\n",
      "because it's gonna add too much to the price .\n",
      "And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises .\n",
      "but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement ?\n",
      "Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple\n",
      "If someone's looking to buy a new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ?\n",
      "or we can look at um user-friendly .\n",
      "And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones\n",
      "or also have the other ones just separate somehow\n",
      "like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way ,\n",
      "that had like the main buttons\n",
      "and then you could like pull something out ,\n",
      "'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them\n",
      "what are we emphasising ? I <disfmarker> what in this project ?\n",
      "Si simplicity and fashion .\n",
      "which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional ,\n",
      "What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional ,\n",
      "I think it's a lot <vocalsound> to do with battery ,\n",
      "So 's just the quality of the chip .\n",
      "So our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ?\n",
      "I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing <disfmarker>\n",
      "S voice recognition ,\n",
      "And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice ,\n",
      "like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote\n",
      "It's for , like , the ultimately lazy people ,\n",
      "I mean if I get m more numbers , I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages .\n",
      "but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something .\n",
      "can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families ?\n",
      "It's it's hard to narrow it down .\n",
      "I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages .\n",
      "so it's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons ,\n",
      "maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age ,\n",
      "So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is <disfmarker>\n",
      "do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost ?\n",
      "Like a button on a T_V_ you can press\n",
      "It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think ,\n",
      "Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost .\n",
      "And <vocalsound> we want um we want large buttons for the essential things .\n",
      "We want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions .\n",
      "Which are kind of hidden away in some way\n",
      "Battery ? Do we need a long-life battery ?\n",
      "We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all .\n",
      "But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod .\n",
      "Yeah , that's that's possible . Yeah .\n",
      "that might contribute to less people losing it too if it <vocalsound> it stays in one place .\n",
      "that's <vocalsound> that's a good idea ,\n",
      "Um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries <disfmarker> summary .\n",
      "After that we have thirty minutes of individual work .\n",
      "Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides .\n",
      "If everyone could do that as well , that'd be great .\n",
      "I_ um I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept ,\n",
      "User Interface , the user interface concept ,\n",
      "market trend wa watching .\n",
      "And as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you .\n",
      "And hopefully , I hope , next time you'll be able to access more of the web site\n",
      "Be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary .\n",
      "were you able to like put yours in the group folder ?\n",
      "Hopefully it is there for people .\n",
      "in there we have technical functions presentation , working design presentation and the functional requirements .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> it's our conceptual design meeting\n",
      "<vocalsound> our agenda ,\n",
      "I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting ,\n",
      "then we'll have your three presentations um\n",
      "and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts ,\n",
      "Um these are our minutes from r the functional design .\n",
      "We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it ,\n",
      "and we said it's for all age groups , different um functions of it .\n",
      "Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion .\n",
      "specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece <vocalsound> and a long-life battery or a charging station .\n",
      "I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials <vocalsound> um and then the conceptual specification of user interface <vocalsound> and finally trend watching .\n",
      "Components design .\n",
      "The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery .\n",
      "uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do ,\n",
      "um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case .\n",
      "I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet ,\n",
      "and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic ,\n",
      "but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic .\n",
      "for buttons we have um pushbuttons ,\n",
      "but we also have scror scroll wheels ,\n",
      "which can have integrated pushbuttons ,\n",
      "or we could go all high-tech\n",
      "and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one ,\n",
      "And then battery I think is where things get most exciting .\n",
      "Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries ,\n",
      "but we also have these options of um <vocalsound> using a kinetic battery ,\n",
      "Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery .\n",
      "Or a solar battery ,\n",
      "although there are slight um <vocalsound> complications with solar batteries\n",
      "as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery .\n",
      "Or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights .\n",
      "Um personal preferences that I was thinking through <disfmarker>\n",
      "here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity .\n",
      "So if we're going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements .\n",
      "Maybe titanium ,\n",
      "maybe some wood .\n",
      "We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials ,\n",
      "And we wanna go for simplicity .\n",
      "Probably pushbuttons ,\n",
      "but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything\n",
      "And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Solar I don't think would be such a good idea ,\n",
      "But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip\n",
      "to keep our costs down .\n",
      "Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ .\n",
      "Is double-curved like <disfmarker> would be like two hands kind of thing ?\n",
      "I'm not sure .\n",
      "but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures .\n",
      "I know if we do have a double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it .\n",
      "um the weight of these different elements , have you <disfmarker>\n",
      "no idea , no idea .\n",
      "Um I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight ,\n",
      "but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me or something .\n",
      "I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device .\n",
      "so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are\n",
      "We have a number of different choices for a design concept um\n",
      "Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> M we don't want lots of buttons , uh complicated features .\n",
      "Here's a a fairly simple device .\n",
      "This is an an iPod from Apple .\n",
      "Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . Um\n",
      "<vocalsound> here's a another example .\n",
      "and I think i it looks pretty cool .\n",
      "Uh it's nice and colourful , it's nice and bright .\n",
      "if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which\n",
      "I <vocalsound> I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often .\n",
      "there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast ,\n",
      "so we need to find a way of including these somehow .\n",
      "we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself ,\n",
      "or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television\n",
      "So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ?\n",
      "I think that's <vocalsound> that's one way to go ,\n",
      "Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display ,\n",
      "an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small ,\n",
      "Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it ,\n",
      "The alternative is to have a <vocalsound> an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . Uh\n",
      "but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's <disfmarker> um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it .\n",
      "I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on .\n",
      "we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching .\n",
      "that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted ,\n",
      "and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year .\n",
      "and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference ,\n",
      "but that really , over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes ,\n",
      "they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel .\n",
      "And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one ,\n",
      "which is doubly important to the third one ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations .\n",
      "And then ease of use was the third most important ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> And then <vocalsound> the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes ,\n",
      "shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy , <vocalsound> tight material .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And so that brings us to my personal preferences .\n",
      "Who wants a spongy remote or one with <vocalsound> fruit and vegetable padding .\n",
      "Personally , I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , um in a year , so\n",
      "Also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction , I'm a little hesitant as to <vocalsound> like , how these questions may have been worded ,\n",
      "and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking .\n",
      "but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most .\n",
      "Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ?\n",
      "could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ?\n",
      "If it's latex <disfmarker> if it's latexy <disfmarker>\n",
      "my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside ,\n",
      "there's something to be said , I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to <disfmarker> R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things\n",
      "I'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ?\n",
      "um couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? Uh like uh I dunno , like uh carrots or something .\n",
      "Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits .\n",
      "What about the idea of like a round remote ? Instead of like a vertical up and down one . Like in terms of holding it . Like that's a f shape of a fruit .\n",
      "would you think you you <disfmarker> do you think you'd be able to hold it ?\n",
      "I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod .\n",
      "or is it li more like a scroll thing ?\n",
      "and you press the centre button ,\n",
      "that's that's your all-purpose select button right there .\n",
      "I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume .\n",
      "I think an <vocalsound> L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice .\n",
      "Um I've one more slide before we close ,\n",
      "but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this <disfmarker> these kinds of things ,\n",
      "Could <disfmarker> Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours ,\n",
      "and then like the the covers could be spongy latex\n",
      "components concept . Energy , chip on print .\n",
      "can you just explain what that is real quick ?\n",
      "what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think it's awesome . I think it's really cool .\n",
      "as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is ,\n",
      "I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced .\n",
      "which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us .\n",
      "I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions .\n",
      "Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think .\n",
      "I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe .\n",
      "if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip ,\n",
      "but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip ,\n",
      "Do we want a scroll wheel ,\n",
      "Um I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel .\n",
      "It would be nice for changing the volume ,\n",
      "but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel .\n",
      "you really need buttons for changing a channel .\n",
      "We have five minutes left for the meeting , so .\n",
      "and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as <disfmarker> I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking .\n",
      "When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus .\n",
      "I think <disfmarker> yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice ,\n",
      "but it's not necessary . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing .\n",
      "could it be hard , and then something around it ?\n",
      "I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing .\n",
      "what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that <vocalsound> there's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex .\n",
      "Um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours .\n",
      "and we want a curved case ,\n",
      "Or a double-curved ?\n",
      "Um <disfmarker> And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons ,\n",
      "For channel surfing I think a scroll <disfmarker> an actual <disfmarker> like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast ,\n",
      "I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case\n",
      "I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel ,\n",
      "it's more just to give it a different kind of look ,\n",
      "but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel .\n",
      "we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons ,\n",
      "and then supplements ,\n",
      "So we're gonna have like a menu button ,\n",
      "we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through .\n",
      "uh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu .\n",
      "Pre-set channels\n",
      "I think maybe numbers seems <disfmarker> is kind of old-fashioned .\n",
      "finishing the meeting now .\n",
      "Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes ,\n",
      "um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation ,\n",
      "and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay .\n",
      "You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach .\n",
      "Um did we decide on a chip ?\n",
      "Let's go with a simple chip ?\n",
      "welcome to our detailed design meeting .\n",
      "and then um I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed um ,\n",
      "then we'll have the prototype presentation\n",
      "and a look at the evaluation criteria .\n",
      "and finally a <disfmarker> do a production evaluation\n",
      "we're gonna use a kinetic battery um ,\n",
      "we want to use a simple chip ,\n",
      "we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved\n",
      "and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu .\n",
      "we made three different prototypes\n",
      "our colours not <disfmarker> are not fixed ,\n",
      "Uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big .\n",
      "We have our up and down buttons ,\n",
      "which are also gonna be our channel selectors ,\n",
      "and we have our little menu button here .\n",
      "If you push <disfmarker> if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if <disfmarker> uh the volume buttons rather .\n",
      "If you press select once , they become channel changing buttons .\n",
      "That's our number one prototype .\n",
      "The little lightning bolt in it , very cute .\n",
      "We call that one the rhombus ,\n",
      "Um this one is known as the potato ,\n",
      "It's an ergonomic shape ,\n",
      "Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . Um\n",
      "the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume .\n",
      "So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here .\n",
      "Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu\n",
      "Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ?\n",
      "it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your T_V_ off .\n",
      "And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear , either way .\n",
      "Um it's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel .\n",
      "Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional ,\n",
      "plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up .\n",
      "We figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if I made the bot the bottom flat . <vocalsound>\n",
      "in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want ,\n",
      "then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons ,\n",
      "and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons\n",
      "normally we'd go for fruity colours ,\n",
      "but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote ,\n",
      "but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost .\n",
      "we were we were talking about that a little bit\n",
      "and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it <disfmarker> it's not just like another piece of technology around your house .\n",
      "It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen .\n",
      "So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss <disfmarker>\n",
      "Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device\n",
      "that like I dunno , you tape to your to your T_V_\n",
      "um that when you press it\n",
      "a little light beep goes off ?\n",
      "I think it would be difficult technologically ,\n",
      "and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else .\n",
      "There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something ,\n",
      "but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon .\n",
      "Um we <disfmarker> so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now .\n",
      "'cause <disfmarker> well , the designs are very bright ,\n",
      "so you're right , they're gonna stick out ,\n",
      "I sort of like this one ,\n",
      "it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking ,\n",
      "But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing\n",
      "Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ?\n",
      "Um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria ,\n",
      "I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for .\n",
      "I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do ,\n",
      "I have to like write something on the whiteboard , so .\n",
      "It's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing ,\n",
      "It makes look more fruity as well .\n",
      "There it could have a stem like that ,\n",
      "is that where people are leaning then , the potato ?\n",
      "Variety of colours are nice .\n",
      "I think I'm leaning towards the potato .\n",
      "that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one .\n",
      "I am worried about like um using a menu .\n",
      "withing menus there are submenus ,\n",
      "and so how do you get back to the main menu ?\n",
      "on the iPod , for example , you just <disfmarker> every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again\n",
      "But that has a menu button separate from a select button ,\n",
      "the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Could these be used for going to submenus\n",
      "maybe it can be one of those ,\n",
      "if you press down and hold\n",
      "for two seconds , then it brings you back one level or something .\n",
      "Potato .\n",
      "some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to .\n",
      "what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately\n",
      "rank each of the following things\n",
      "and then I'll tabulate an average\n",
      "and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven\n",
      "with one being really extremely true\n",
      "and seven being not true at all , or false ,\n",
      "First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective .\n",
      "in my opinion the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle\n",
      "so I'm gonna say it's like a three .\n",
      "I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two .\n",
      "I dunno if fancy is the word I would use .\n",
      "and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ?\n",
      "I think it's extremely functional ,\n",
      "I think it'll get everything done ,\n",
      "then I'm gonna give it a two .\n",
      "Um is it technologically innovative ?\n",
      "Mm . Not really , I mean not so much ,\n",
      "'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen ,\n",
      "the kinetic battery .\n",
      "How many people would notice that , though ?\n",
      "And if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty cool .\n",
      "Think I'm gonna go with the four as well .\n",
      "Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality\n",
      "and <vocalsound> if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I <disfmarker> it's spongy all the way . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Give it a one .\n",
      "and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables <vocalsound> ?\n",
      "is it gonna be yellow ?\n",
      "We might wanna keep it yellow .\n",
      "I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing ,\n",
      "but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in <disfmarker> and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one\n",
      "and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that's more fruity .\n",
      "Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something ?\n",
      "it was inspired by the potato ,\n",
      "so I think it's pretty fruity .\n",
      "I think i it's kind of mangoey too .\n",
      "That's a much more trendy than a potato <vocalsound>\n",
      "um , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ?\n",
      "Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons ,\n",
      "so I'm gonna give it a one .\n",
      "also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing .\n",
      "Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ?\n",
      "I think I'll give it a two ,\n",
      "And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing ,\n",
      "And the ease of learning it .\n",
      "The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing ,\n",
      "but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards .\n",
      "So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess .\n",
      "because you have to you have to use the menu system\n",
      "and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are\n",
      "and that could take a bit of learning at first ,\n",
      "So I'd I'd give it a four .\n",
      "also earlier we had something about losing it\n",
      "and so now we're not addressing that at all ,\n",
      "I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour ,\n",
      "I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> how w how well does it address just being simple ?\n",
      "Um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple ,\n",
      "I'm <gap> give it a three I guess .\n",
      "and fashionable ?\n",
      "It's totally fashionable .\n",
      "I think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well .\n",
      "And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , that whole thing ?\n",
      "if we offer in a <disfmarker> in at least three different colour arrangements .\n",
      "So I'll give it a a two <gap> .\n",
      "we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo ,\n",
      "so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it .\n",
      "I think all of them should have an R_R_ .\n",
      "now we're gonna look at finances .\n",
      "Um I have an Excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost um ,\n",
      "We're using kinetic battery ,\n",
      "Simple .\n",
      "Guess it's double-curved .\n",
      "don't we need plastic , and <disfmarker>\n",
      "It was rubber and special colour ,\n",
      "we're using <disfmarker> we're gonna need at least two special colours .\n",
      "I don't know what the se the basic colour is though .\n",
      "like we'll have yellow and black .\n",
      "Maybe the R_R_ will be in colour as well ,\n",
      "And how many buttons do we have ?\n",
      "We have six .\n",
      "the case material will just have one colour ,\n",
      "but then the buttons will be in special colours ?\n",
      "Special form ?\n",
      "I think they're fine .\n",
      "Material , we want them rubber as well probably , yeah .\n",
      "Thirteen point seven .\n",
      "what can we reduce ?\n",
      "let's have our buttons all be one colour .\n",
      "Maybe it's single-curved ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> It's single curved .\n",
      "case material is rubber\n",
      "and it's a special colour ,\n",
      "It was it was thirteen\n",
      "and now it's fifteen .\n",
      "Now it's twelve .\n",
      "What was our target price again ?\n",
      "Twelve point five .\n",
      "So we're okay , I think .\n",
      "Um are the <disfmarker> are the costs under twelve fifty Euro ?\n",
      "Let's move on to the project evaluation .\n",
      "Project process . Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found .\n",
      "So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project ,\n",
      "the information we got on the news , how we used it ,\n",
      "if we were able to um , you know , use our creativity with the information ,\n",
      "um how how well I guess I led it ,\n",
      "um the <disfmarker> how well we worked together as a team ,\n",
      "um the digital pens ,\n",
      "the whiteboard .\n",
      "I felt very creative . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think we've been successful\n",
      "I enjoyed making the prototypes .\n",
      "I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information ,\n",
      "like what's a single-curved case ,\n",
      "but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well .\n",
      "if I'd had more market research on the <gap> fruits and vegetables , maybe we could've taken that into account .\n",
      "I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally ,\n",
      "That was the last one , like I chose not to do a PowerPoint\n",
      "I think we all made um very significant contributions ,\n",
      "I don't think anybody dominated it ,\n",
      "Mm . What did we find for new ideas ?\n",
      "People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables .\n",
      "I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them .\n",
      "Is the project evaluated ?\n",
      "there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary .\n",
      "this is the great product kids ,\n",
      "and that we have a market for it , um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three\n",
      "Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the um the final results\n",
      "<vocalsound> I do like the Martian remote .\n",
      "If we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice .\n",
      "Although the tog toggle\n",
      "I would break it . <vocalsound> I would break it .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Is <disfmarker> it started as a pear ,\n",
      "Kind of looks like a penguin , like <vocalsound> with no eye <vocalsound> .\n",
      "Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over ,\n",
      "I got more master classes ,\n",
      "what did I get through the corporate website ?\n",
      "It's just inspiration about circuit boards .\n",
      "the Excel thing is pretty cool .\n",
      "Yes .\n",
      "I learned a lot actually .\n",
      "I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to .\n",
      "I wrote it all down ,\n",
      "because I thought it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control ,\n",
      "but then they're like , you don't actually need this <disfmarker>\n",
      "I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing .\n",
      "otherwise the technology <gap> today was kinda cool .\n",
      "We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much .\n",
      "Although I don't see how we could have very l at least for me\n",
      "and I think usually , like whiteboards are good , you know like crossing out ideas , or like if we had had like a brainstorming period .\n",
      "we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it ,\n",
      "And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint\n",
      "'cause we all needed them separately , kind of on the whiteboards in this room .\n",
      "when you were um creating your um prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ?\n",
      "Uh we we worked together ,\n",
      "we sort of made different shapes\n",
      "well done with the management , I felt well managed .\n",
      "I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time ,\n",
      "It's kinda fun .\n",
      "we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings .\n",
      "I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided .\n",
      "But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points <gap> at the end of the meetings ,\n",
      "I think the last time we had a lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough ,\n",
      "like we we couldn't answer every single question .\n",
      "And I I felt the first two meetings , that I was coming in with no information ,\n",
      "Um . I'm a little <disfmarker> I am a little disappointed that we didn't do a <disfmarker> um something for losing the remote ,\n",
      "Just gonna make <disfmarker> I'm making full minutes ,\n",
      "so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that .\n",
      "How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you ,\n",
      "Most of it ,\n",
      "I didn't even think about adding slides ,\n",
      "'cause I would just get slides with titles on them\n",
      "I think the R_ and R_ , especially if the yellow and black one .\n",
      "I think we just need the um the R_R_ ,\n",
      "'cause they didn't give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or <gap> .\n",
      "I guess it is black , grey .\n",
      "I just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation , you wouldn't just have like one set of source ,\n",
      "We're gonna just do a quick opening\n",
      "and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another\n",
      "um then we're gonna start <disfmarker> talk a little bit about tool training .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this\n",
      "we're making a remote control\n",
      "Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible ,\n",
      "and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me <vocalsound> tell us what's possible\n",
      "and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go\n",
      "and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible\n",
      "So it's a three stage kind of thing .\n",
      "for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it ,\n",
      "um and just write down <disfmarker> I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs\n",
      "I'm a excellent Project Manager . Um .\n",
      "I'm Marty ,\n",
      "I'm Sarah ,\n",
      "and I'm the Marketing Manager or something .\n",
      "I'm Ron .\n",
      "and I am the User Interface Designer .\n",
      "I'm Nathan ,\n",
      "uh project finance .\n",
      "what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros . Um . <vocalsound>\n",
      "it's pretty dear ,\n",
      "the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it .\n",
      "Eur internationally .\n",
      "one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably .\n",
      "Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty .\n",
      "um <vocalsound> and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there\n",
      "I need you to tell us what um <vocalsound> we <disfmarker> what the user's gonna want .\n",
      "<vocalsound> and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between\n",
      "we can't kind of build it into other uh products .\n",
      "For instance like a mobile phone or something like that .\n",
      "I don't think there's any rules about it yet . So <disfmarker>\n",
      "can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ?\n",
      "Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones .\n",
      "does anybody have any initial ideas ?\n",
      "as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door\n",
      "but then , I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons ,\n",
      "But <disfmarker> I'm thinking <disfmarker> I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design\n",
      "so touch screen design rather than button\n",
      "so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things .\n",
      "we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between um <vocalsound> uh size and functionality .\n",
      "but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart ,\n",
      "maybe like an L_ <disfmarker> like a touch screen type of remote ?\n",
      "An interesting option .\n",
      "Needs <disfmarker> it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes .\n",
      "I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important ,\n",
      "because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality .\n",
      "there's such a problem with losing them ,\n",
      "that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose ,\n",
      "I like the idea of the uh multi plate .\n",
      "I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device ,\n",
      "maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote .\n",
      "there used to be those whistling devices\n",
      "Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing\n",
      "that you could place something else\n",
      "and it makes the remote page .\n",
      "so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price .\n",
      "Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote\n",
      "Or if you our users in mind ,\n",
      "these <disfmarker> grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design ,\n",
      "they're used to the buttons\n",
      "so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to ,\n",
      "I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um <vocalsound> project documents ,\n",
      "I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um <vocalsound> remote control .\n",
      "And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found\n",
      "and then we'll have a bit of discussion .\n",
      "what I've just found out from the board\n",
      "but it needs to be television only .\n",
      "we're not doing D_V_D_ ,\n",
      "Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it .\n",
      "that's red and black .\n",
      "And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics .\n",
      "Um and no teletext .\n",
      "I'm not sure what teletext is\n",
      "so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design .\n",
      "<vocalsound> For reasons that I don't really know .\n",
      "but it's the board so there you go .\n",
      "given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design\n",
      "we'll discuss it later\n",
      "I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation\n",
      "We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project .\n",
      "Um remote control works as follows .\n",
      "Um sends message to another system ,\n",
      "there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines ,\n",
      "there's an integrated circuit ,\n",
      "which is the microchip ,\n",
      "and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system .\n",
      "A user interface controls the chip ,\n",
      "basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well .\n",
      "and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands .\n",
      "And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals .\n",
      "Um too much metal is used sometimes\n",
      "and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire\n",
      "just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad .\n",
      "Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction .\n",
      "Um , components . Just some ideas that I had ,\n",
      "um , energy source ,\n",
      "it's kinda hip to be eco friendly\n",
      "so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup .\n",
      "Um the user interface ,\n",
      "since we can't use metal\n",
      "I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic .\n",
      "The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that ,\n",
      "Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared\n",
      "'cause it is the industry standard ,\n",
      "Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible\n",
      "and uh probably a two hundred foot range .\n",
      "Um personal preferences ,\n",
      "I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal ,\n",
      "which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics\n",
      "that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value\n",
      "on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice ,\n",
      "Yeah that shouldn't be a problem .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well .\n",
      "Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation .\n",
      "Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device ,\n",
      "it needs to be universal\n",
      "um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices\n",
      "although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem .\n",
      "Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set .\n",
      "Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing ,\n",
      "some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control\n",
      "sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well\n",
      "but uh this remote control has many functions\n",
      "but it uh it is quite complicated\n",
      "and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions\n",
      "because they don't know how to use them\n",
      "and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it .\n",
      "Um . Another remote control , slightly different ,\n",
      "it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions ,\n",
      "um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use .\n",
      "Um it also has a bit of a cheap look\n",
      "and it's also quite boring .\n",
      "my personal preferences .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control .\n",
      "Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device\n",
      "but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with .\n",
      "Um . Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face\n",
      "I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got\n",
      "and we had a usability test\n",
      "where we were actually sort <disfmarker> like watching a hundred people <vocalsound> use T_V_ remotes\n",
      "and see what it is that they're using\n",
      "and then they filled out a questionnaire\n",
      "about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices .\n",
      "Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume ,\n",
      "the majority of the time that's all that's going on ,\n",
      "the other functions happen ,\n",
      "for some people they're important ,\n",
      "but the primary uses are really really basic .\n",
      "Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use ,\n",
      "they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their <disfmarker> the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they can't find it in the room .\n",
      "So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes ,\n",
      "and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful ,\n",
      "and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options .\n",
      "I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically ,\n",
      "but it is s something worth thinking about ,\n",
      "especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing ,\n",
      "Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are\n",
      "I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um <vocalsound> through you guys's presentations\n",
      "um <vocalsound> we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Um Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions\n",
      "um but we need to decide who are we selling this to ,\n",
      "you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> um so do we wanna go for that ,\n",
      "or do we want to go for an older demographic ,\n",
      "if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics <vocalsound> um . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so .\n",
      "So maybe this <disfmarker> we should look into this younger demographic .\n",
      "<vocalsound> uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster\n",
      "um think we're constrained to plastics\n",
      "we've got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um ,\n",
      "this voice operation thing is <disfmarker> I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable , um at least for the basic controls ,\n",
      "you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_\n",
      "but we might be able to say um <vocalsound> volume up .\n",
      "I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology .\n",
      "With a simple command like locate .\n",
      "And then it could start to beep\n",
      "The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find .\n",
      "but then again you have this wee <disfmarker> this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too .\n",
      "A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television .\n",
      "but <disfmarker> yeah I like that , I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system .\n",
      "<vocalsound> The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control .\n",
      "So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market .\n",
      "and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not .\n",
      "Are we still thinking about this screen <disfmarker>\n",
      "if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that's an option technically right now to that ?\n",
      "'S definitely an option technically .\n",
      "I've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not ,\n",
      "they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point .\n",
      "especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions ,\n",
      "menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things\n",
      "Gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things .\n",
      "It seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip .\n",
      "I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development\n",
      "I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them ,\n",
      "but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control .\n",
      "Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it\n",
      "I guess we've c we've touched on most of this . The idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates . Um .\n",
      "we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ?\n",
      "I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable .\n",
      "We could have the casing , the the face plates .\n",
      "<vocalsound> We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ?\n",
      "Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere .\n",
      "in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around ,\n",
      "whereas you're just sit at home ,\n",
      "we can <disfmarker> we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth , um .\n",
      "but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important .\n",
      "have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah I think that would be best .\n",
      "based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased\n",
      "try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic\n",
      "With a touch screen for the basic functions . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "let's provisionally <disfmarker> let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff\n",
      "basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen .\n",
      "it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost .\n",
      "'Cause it would have a docking base ?\n",
      "But then again that costs as well .\n",
      "these new lithium batteries they last twenty years <vocalsound> even with the touch screen ?\n",
      "I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in\n",
      "if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um\n",
      "Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button\n",
      "that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control\n",
      "to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep .\n",
      "Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ?\n",
      "Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody .\n",
      "What what would be on that touch screen ?\n",
      "'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um\n",
      "logo or something or motto ,\n",
      "it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control .\n",
      "Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen .\n",
      "I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device .\n",
      "it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading\n",
      "Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it\n",
      "'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think .\n",
      "it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there .\n",
      "People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on .\n",
      "They just want it to be on and ready to go .\n",
      "But then again who wants to turn on a remote control .\n",
      "all you have to do is touch the screen\n",
      "and it automatically goes on .\n",
      "or go into like a dormant mode .\n",
      "I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders .\n",
      "and the minutes that I'll do it in a second\n",
      "and put them in the shared folder for later reference .\n",
      "I've put my files in the shared folder as well .\n",
      "this meeting will be about the conceptual design ,\n",
      "Um , think of it <disfmarker> 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete .\n",
      "In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .\n",
      "apologies for the last meeting ,\n",
      "it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough ,\n",
      "um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting .\n",
      "basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time ,\n",
      "um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic\n",
      "uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work .\n",
      "basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design\n",
      "and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do\n",
      "Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that .\n",
      "Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this\n",
      "but we're gonna have to get into more detail\n",
      "Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells .\n",
      "Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium\n",
      "if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere .\n",
      "Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility .\n",
      "Basically , it's like a um <disfmarker> the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running .\n",
      "but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen .\n",
      "Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood .\n",
      "Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat ,\n",
      "which we probably don't wanna do ,\n",
      "curved or very sexy double curved .\n",
      "What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?\n",
      "Um , I imagine that we could specify .\n",
      "Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer ,\n",
      "but to use those we'd have to use more chips ,\n",
      "And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons\n",
      "because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .\n",
      "touch screen equals many chips\n",
      "which equals many Euro .\n",
      "Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum .\n",
      "So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it\n",
      "but in fact there is light coming out of the remote\n",
      "Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting\n",
      "was to use part <disfmarker> use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick .\n",
      "So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .\n",
      "is there an option that we can have that off or on\n",
      "so a person can select like <disfmarker>\n",
      "I am sure that we could do that .\n",
      "just as a fun gimmick .\n",
      "Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip .\n",
      "Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five .\n",
      "we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer ,\n",
      "um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies\n",
      "or should we just make do with what we have available ?\n",
      "I'd say shop around\n",
      "but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?\n",
      "Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer .\n",
      "My personal preference is <disfmarker>\n",
      "uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route ,\n",
      "just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on .\n",
      "Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling ,\n",
      "and uh I was thinking about <disfmarker> I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes .\n",
      "Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now\n",
      "and what's going on in other design fields ,\n",
      "to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening .\n",
      "Um , remote control right now <disfmarker> basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting <disfmarker>\n",
      "um <disfmarker> that we need innovative design options\n",
      "and there needs to be an easy user interface .\n",
      "Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing .\n",
      "Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything ,\n",
      "but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours ,\n",
      "like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean ,\n",
      "Different skin options ,\n",
      "and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy ,\n",
      "though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh\n",
      "not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something <disfmarker>\n",
      "As far as the rubber that we can use <disfmarker> we can use a rubber as part of the case ,\n",
      "it has a consistency of those stress balls .\n",
      "I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now .\n",
      "but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue .\n",
      "I like the idea of of rubber too\n",
      "I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line ,\n",
      "interface concept by your faithful user interface designer .\n",
      "So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive .\n",
      "Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system .\n",
      "Here's a d series of different remote controls\n",
      "that are out on the market today .\n",
      "the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts .\n",
      "Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team\n",
      "current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples ,\n",
      "um and basically you record your own verbal labels\n",
      "c and connect them to the remote control .\n",
      "our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system\n",
      "in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um <disfmarker> with standard responses .\n",
      "Like you could say good morning uh remote control\n",
      "and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . Um .\n",
      "Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod\n",
      "Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern <gap> a bit bulky , a bit crazy ,\n",
      "I don't think that's we're necessarily going for .\n",
      "And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your <disfmarker> for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming\n",
      "but uh I <disfmarker> again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . Um\n",
      "and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here .\n",
      "Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose .\n",
      "so I <disfmarker> I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing\n",
      "Uh changeable casings uh <disfmarker> our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package\n",
      "Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system\n",
      "so those don't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels .\n",
      "Um , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already\n",
      "and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around\n",
      "red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not .\n",
      "And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea\n",
      "Now we kind of have to come to some decisions ,\n",
      "and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um .\n",
      "Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um <vocalsound> various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ?\n",
      "I think it's our most marketable feature\n",
      "But can we really afford it\n",
      "My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote ,\n",
      "that's just an estimate though .\n",
      "it's just , it is a question of <disfmarker> and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money .\n",
      "Where do you guys come up with these numbers ?\n",
      "That's just off the top of my head ,\n",
      "I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something <disfmarker>\n",
      "we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins\n",
      "rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty ,\n",
      "but that's something that we can have finance deal with .\n",
      "Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen\n",
      "and we can look into this other manufacturing option ,\n",
      "and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper .\n",
      "let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> our main selling point here .\n",
      "I mean I think that we really have two main selling points ,\n",
      "'cause with voice recognition <disfmarker>\n",
      "I think that our casing and the voice recognition <disfmarker>\n",
      "I mean , <vocalsound> if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on ,\n",
      "I think we might have to drop the voice rec .\n",
      "I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely .\n",
      "To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house ,\n",
      "I mean we've we've come up with this , with this new voice <disfmarker>\n",
      "What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ?\n",
      "I think if we <disfmarker> we do both the <disfmarker> obviously production costs are going to go way up\n",
      "I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say .\n",
      "and they said they wanted voice recognition .\n",
      "Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option ,\n",
      "but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition\n",
      "Does having both really up our costs ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> I can't see how it wouldn't ,\n",
      "so we have to pick between one of the two . Um .\n",
      "we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent .\n",
      "But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction\n",
      "but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with\n",
      "I think the voice recognition is simpler ,\n",
      "Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ?\n",
      "Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind ,\n",
      "but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition\n",
      "we're not gonna have to do as much design work\n",
      "more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better .\n",
      "We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .\n",
      "You discussed either a lithium or a solar power .\n",
      "Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ?\n",
      "Um , the solar power definitely would be\n",
      "but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed ,\n",
      "we should install a small backup battery .\n",
      "we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere\n",
      "it works about the same as a solar powered calculator ,\n",
      "and you know how those those don't really require that much light ,\n",
      "I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said .\n",
      "If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control\n",
      "and maybe kind of have a round remote control\n",
      "that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something .\n",
      "Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ?\n",
      "if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point .\n",
      "if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job .\n",
      "Do you think people that are <disfmarker> people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition\n",
      "I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people ,\n",
      "like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too ,\n",
      "we have to have buttons on it too as well .\n",
      "I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing ,\n",
      "it could still have the basic buttons on it .\n",
      "And maybe a menu button and so forth ,\n",
      "use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever\n",
      "because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote .\n",
      "I'm thinking of the airport portal ,\n",
      "you know like that little pod looking thing ?\n",
      "I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing\n",
      "but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um <disfmarker>\n",
      "Terracotta bowl or something . <vocalsound>\n",
      "And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh <disfmarker> using like a rubber kind of softer feel ,\n",
      "if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit <disfmarker> gives just a bit .\n",
      "something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it .\n",
      "Just kind of the squishy feel .\n",
      "let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control .\n",
      "<vocalsound> um . I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um .\n",
      "Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost ,\n",
      "I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers\n",
      "we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um <vocalsound> a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex .\n",
      "although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions ,\n",
      "they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually ,\n",
      "Like maybe have menu things .\n",
      "If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out\n",
      "and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things .\n",
      "we could do a slide or a compartment ,\n",
      "Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um <disfmarker> like on a D_V_D_ player .\n",
      "we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use ,\n",
      "are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "it seems to me that we could just do the um <disfmarker> stick with the rubber\n",
      "'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um <vocalsound> rubber for the outside case\n",
      "I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons\n",
      "have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ?\n",
      "because you have different cases\n",
      "and that might open up your market a little bit obviously ,\n",
      "but obviously having more cases also costs more\n",
      "you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something .\n",
      "That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the <gap> thing .\n",
      "let's work on <vocalsound> uh multiple case colours .\n",
      "stick with the same kind of kinda <disfmarker> yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design .\n",
      "we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um .\n",
      "Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel ,\n",
      "Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . <vocalsound>\n",
      "And um Ron if you can\n",
      "figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple .\n",
      "Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff .\n",
      "Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> using um <vocalsound> prototype building materials um <vocalsound> .\n",
      "And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well .\n",
      "here we have our detailed design meeting\n",
      "where we will um look at the prototype\n",
      "I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my <disfmarker>\n",
      "It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .\n",
      "um <vocalsound> just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting ,\n",
      "basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh <disfmarker> last meeting was that <vocalsound> um we that we had meetings from <disfmarker> uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here\n",
      "and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition ,\n",
      "I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape\n",
      "um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote\n",
      "since you could just use your voice .\n",
      "That would include some <disfmarker> mostly just the simple design features for a television operation\n",
      "but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users .\n",
      "the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at .\n",
      "we have assembled our prototype , um .\n",
      "Um , we took into account a lot of the things\n",
      "that we went over in the last meeting , um .\n",
      "Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen\n",
      "and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um .\n",
      "This is going to be the on off button\n",
      "and we have these buttons to go through the channels\n",
      "um and then two volume buttons down here ,\n",
      "d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons .\n",
      "And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here\n",
      "um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on .\n",
      "and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um .\n",
      "As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out ,\n",
      "Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um .\n",
      "we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces\n",
      "and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here\n",
      "um f we call it fruity\n",
      "of course that's uh interchangeable\n",
      "and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued\n",
      "but this is kind of something that can be done\n",
      "um and as you can see on the television there\n",
      "uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there .\n",
      "Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption .\n",
      "if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel ,\n",
      "clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available .\n",
      "Um I worried about the materials ,\n",
      "uh <disfmarker> the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating\n",
      "it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped .\n",
      "and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel .\n",
      "I dunno if you noticed ,\n",
      "but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen ,\n",
      "Um , but I think that's <disfmarker> I think that sums up the main features of our <disfmarker> of the remote ,\n",
      "Um , did we come in under budget ?\n",
      "to put this into um production , we're looking at about <disfmarker>\n",
      "It was twelve fifty Euro\n",
      "um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine .\n",
      "um <disfmarker> obviously we had a choice with the buttons\n",
      "whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons ,\n",
      "but we just went for a classic rubber button\n",
      "So even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition ,\n",
      "in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote\n",
      "<vocalsound> Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ?\n",
      "on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console\n",
      "and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look .\n",
      "Um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with .\n",
      "and um , I think that uh has given a proven um <vocalsound> ease of use and what not .\n",
      "And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ?\n",
      "or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ?\n",
      "we didn't quite have enough material uh <vocalsound> .\n",
      "as you can see this is just a most superficial layer\n",
      "and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like <disfmarker>\n",
      "Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips\n",
      "and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that .\n",
      "we definitely priced out a spongy <disfmarker> even spongier non-natural look um materials\n",
      "We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green .\n",
      "It's not it's not quite a a face plate ,\n",
      "it's more like a pseudo-face plate\n",
      "it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent\n",
      "but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments\n",
      "and we could go the face plate way\n",
      "Very cool , nice job .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um , <vocalsound> what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um\n",
      "you provided a number\n",
      "that actually sounds quite nice .\n",
      "Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance .\n",
      "Um , it's a spreadsheet of the parts <vocalsound>\n",
      "and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um .\n",
      "if we can just itemize what's in here ,\n",
      "it's a solar cell thing\n",
      "With a back-up battery ?\n",
      "The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . Yeah .\n",
      "<vocalsound> It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time\n",
      "Um and the case , it's more of a single-curved case ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout .\n",
      "Um . Push button interface um with this other drop-down\n",
      "so maybe we've got two push button interfaces\n",
      "And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well ,\n",
      "'Cause it i it is very unconventional ,\n",
      "M come in at sixteen ?\n",
      "a bit over budget , um .\n",
      "what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells\n",
      "<vocalsound> um or take out the back-up battery . Uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not ,\n",
      "I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see\n",
      "but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time\n",
      "and saying oh look my remote isn't working\n",
      "I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery ,\n",
      "I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing ,\n",
      "but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget\n",
      "I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that <disfmarker> we <disfmarker> our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing\n",
      "I mean that's what sets us apart\n",
      "perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game\n",
      "And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell ,\n",
      "but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here\n",
      "and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here\n",
      "and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell .\n",
      "I think unfortunately that's our best option .\n",
      "'Cause we can't remove the push buttons\n",
      "um , nor would changing the case materials .\n",
      "Gotta do what you gotta do .\n",
      "I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah .\n",
      "I guess now we just go to the project evaluation\n",
      "basically I was just evaluating um <vocalsound> from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of <disfmarker>\n",
      "these are the things we needed to do ,\n",
      "these are the things that look like we feel they're important .\n",
      "Um so I was looking at basic design things ,\n",
      "Is the design what we wanted it to do ?\n",
      "are technologies up to where we hoped they would be\n",
      "and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? Um .\n",
      "Does it respond to voice recognition ?\n",
      "And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par .\n",
      "Um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting\n",
      "but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense .\n",
      "So I think overall we're headed in the right direction .\n",
      "They like that spongy feel .\n",
      "I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options\n",
      "and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff ,\n",
      "I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel\n",
      "this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um .\n",
      "I got this slide from the coach\n",
      "and I'm not sure what it's connected to .\n",
      "Um so I guess we are going to discuss um <vocalsound> our project process um\n",
      "I guess this is the point where we go um <vocalsound> uh out of role it looks like\n",
      "and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth\n",
      "and how that all worked , I guess , um .\n",
      "As in within the team or ?\n",
      "I think so yeah .\n",
      "Are we considering these points here ?\n",
      "I think they're starting blocks\n",
      "I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were <vocalsound> relatively productive ,\n",
      "considering the little amount of input we had going in .\n",
      "Um , and the technology has definitely been a help ,\n",
      "it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff .\n",
      "We didn't use the whiteboard at all .\n",
      "No , no whiteboard . <vocalsound>\n",
      "and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed\n",
      "but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter .\n",
      "Um , also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all ,\n",
      "I didn't write barely anything .\n",
      "Was pretty cool tack though .\n",
      "I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Attempts to contact coach ineffective <vocalsound> .\n",
      "n I think there was a lot of room for creativity ,\n",
      "we could do whatever <disfmarker> basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um .\n",
      "And even then we did get a decent product turned out\n",
      "although it's not everything we wanted it to be .\n",
      "I think , yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think the teamwork was good as well .\n",
      "My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with ,\n",
      "You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours .\n",
      "What did you guys think about the the the roles ?\n",
      "I think it was pretty clever\n",
      "'cause we were never able to get too far off track\n",
      "because the information came in at the right time\n",
      "and kind of filled in the gaps enough .\n",
      "At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up ,\n",
      "Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day .\n",
      "but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all .\n",
      "Nothing , I didn't even get an email ,\n",
      "I feel like that was slightly lacking\n",
      "when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing <vocalsound>\n",
      "um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was\n",
      "and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more ,\n",
      "I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you\n",
      "Yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot .\n",
      "'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time .\n",
      "And I think your leadership was quite good .\n",
      "It was really good yeah .\n",
      "I did get <disfmarker> I I felt like I got way too into it .\n",
      "But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the <disfmarker> okay ?\n",
      "except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand\n",
      "Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ?\n",
      "No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno ,\n",
      "I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't <disfmarker> except for the actual building ,\n",
      "but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board <disfmarker>\n",
      "and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings .\n",
      "is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ?\n",
      "I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires ,\n",
      "I was afraid I was gonna break something actually .\n",
      "and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or .\n",
      "I dunno what I woulda shown on that board .\n",
      "it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for .\n",
      "Usually I would do a lot more doodling too\n",
      "I felt like I needed to be professional\n",
      "I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like .\n",
      "is this all we need to get through ?\n",
      "I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about .\n",
      "It <disfmarker> did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ?\n",
      "that's the thing I got <disfmarker> i in the email I got this PowerPoint file\n",
      "I didn't change this one at all .\n",
      "Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "Uh I think they still do their job .\n",
      "how much can you do with a remote control ?\n",
      "how long was our meeting supposed to be ?\n",
      "I I I mm we should go on a bit <disfmarker> yeah <disfmarker> about the project eval , um .\n",
      "I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing .\n",
      "at the beginning it started out\n",
      "and I felt actually like under pressure\n",
      "and I was like <disfmarker> had like all this brainstorming I was doing\n",
      "and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation\n",
      "that you guys don't really care about anyway\n",
      "like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it\n",
      "Definitely when <vocalsound> when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to <disfmarker> how much I stressed over it\n",
      "and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much .\n",
      "Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation\n",
      "every single one I <disfmarker> a all the presentations I either added slides\n",
      "or edited 'em .\n",
      "My slides were all blank ,\n",
      "they'd have a title maybe\n",
      "with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class .\n",
      "An interesting day all in all I would say .\n",
      "It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . You know from the the the basics to the conce\n",
      "although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept .\n",
      "we've established that the costs weren't really within budget ,\n",
      "We did the project evaluation based on um <vocalsound> Sarah's evaluation of on off switches\n",
      "though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general .\n",
      "And it's all recorded ,\n",
      "I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end\n",
      "so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like <disfmarker>\n",
      "uh I will save this into the project documents .\n",
      "You guys ready to celebrate ?\n",
      "that's our last step . Celebration .\n",
      "I think so .\n",
      "I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part .\n",
      "I guess we'll call that a a doner .\n",
      "that's the end of the meeting .\n",
      "Hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing .\n",
      "Um I'm Mandy and I'm the Project Manager .\n",
      "And I know all your names again , Courtney , Fenella and Amber .\n",
      "Okay , here is our agenda for this meeting .\n",
      "Um tool training , we're going to , I guess , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles .\n",
      "Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting .\n",
      "We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original , trendy and also user-friendly .\n",
      "We're gonna have <disfmarker> discuss the functional design first , <vocalsound> how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate T_V_ , blah blah blah .\n",
      "And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet .\n",
      "Same thing with conceptual design .\n",
      "And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote .\n",
      "First we're gonna start off by using our tools .\n",
      "I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing .\n",
      "Um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal .\n",
      "Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro ,\n",
      "and our profit aim is fifty million Euro .\n",
      "We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States , in Europe , in Asia .\n",
      "And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote .\n",
      "Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss .\n",
      "Expe our experiences with remote controls um , our first ideas about this new remote ,\n",
      "anything that you can bring to the table for this project .\n",
      "Well , we wanna make a multifunctional remote ,\n",
      "It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal .\n",
      "and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand .\n",
      "If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't <disfmarker> Nobody wants to buy those any more .\n",
      "They want the ergonomic ones .\n",
      "What kinda battery would we want to use ?\n",
      "Double A_ .\n",
      "So double or triple ?\n",
      "it's okay , we don't have to decide about it now ,\n",
      "you're going to think about the working design .\n",
      "And U_I_D_ , the technical fun functions design ,\n",
      "And the marketing person , that's Courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification .\n",
      "This is the functional design meeting .\n",
      "Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting .\n",
      "After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes .\n",
      "And we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you .\n",
      "First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting .\n",
      "First we need to determine the user requirements\n",
      "And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus ,\n",
      "And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions ,\n",
      "the function <vocalsound> of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set ,\n",
      "for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera .\n",
      "whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus .\n",
      "And we can decide if that's what we want , <gap> , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example .\n",
      "These are two examples .\n",
      "Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons ,\n",
      "And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler ,\n",
      "And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider\n",
      "like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ?\n",
      "Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements .\n",
      "okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab ,\n",
      "and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire ,\n",
      "Seventy five percent think they're ugly .\n",
      "Eighty percent want <disfmarker> they've <disfmarker> are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier ,\n",
      "And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . So <disfmarker>\n",
      "What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons .\n",
      "I I think it's like the engineering versus user ,\n",
      "and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And so people say that they typically lose it ,\n",
      "and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is .\n",
      "Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ?\n",
      "Uh yeah , that's what my web site said ,\n",
      "I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly .\n",
      "And also we found <disfmarker> our team found that speech recognition is <disfmarker> it's like an up-and-coming thing\n",
      "<vocalsound> Didn't they <disfmarker> um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would <disfmarker> the remote would beep so if you have lost it <disfmarker>\n",
      "We could definitely include that if we wanted to .\n",
      "'Kay . Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating .\n",
      "We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional .\n",
      "Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip .\n",
      "Um power source , I figured , batteries ,\n",
      "Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three .\n",
      "so a large on-off button would probably be good .\n",
      "Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness ,\n",
      "but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance .\n",
      "Like that we know the battery's working .\n",
      "We should make it glow in the dark . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Well , should it be larger buttons in general ,\n",
      "I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles .\n",
      "New product requirements .\n",
      "First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote .\n",
      "So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo .\n",
      "so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote .\n",
      "But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet .\n",
      "Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news ,\n",
      "Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ?\n",
      "Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically <disfmarker>\n",
      "non-technically challenged people are gonna use it .\n",
      "so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range <disfmarker>\n",
      "we we need a like homing device .\n",
      "And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger ,\n",
      "and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you .\n",
      "Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery .\n",
      "Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually .\n",
      "If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic .\n",
      "It's really the people twenty five to thirty five .\n",
      "<gap> and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too .\n",
      "Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ?\n",
      "Well , we definitely need those .\n",
      "And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo .\n",
      "We could just have the logo in yellow ,\n",
      "or maybe a yellow light for the keys .\n",
      "If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom <gap> the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ .\n",
      "So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind ,\n",
      "or no menu buttons .\n",
      "So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those\n",
      "or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ?\n",
      "I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ .\n",
      "you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons .\n",
      "So we just have it like <disfmarker> add a menu button then for the various things needed ,\n",
      "The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept ,\n",
      "um U_I_D_ the user interface concept ,\n",
      "and you're going to do some trend watching .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting .\n",
      "Um we're gonna open it and I'm gonna keep the minutes as Project Manager .\n",
      "We're gonna have three presentations ,\n",
      "And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts\n",
      "Okay , so trend watching .\n",
      "fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional ,\n",
      "and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use .\n",
      "So the customer basically is confused .\n",
      "So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns .\n",
      "um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year .\n",
      "Um . But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , I don't know if we really want to go with that ,\n",
      "um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled\n",
      "And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something .\n",
      "So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone\n",
      "where we put the buttons around , like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle ,\n",
      "So it's classically retro .\n",
      "looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this .\n",
      "Um uh can't really see , but there's two possible ways ,\n",
      "on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down ,\n",
      "And then on the right , we have what's really big trend right now , it's the iPod .\n",
      "and it's sort of like you have the both <gap> kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and um and very simple , but technologically advanced .\n",
      "Um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight .\n",
      "for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow .\n",
      "Um this is particularly geared towards children .\n",
      "Um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking .\n",
      "and then down at the bottom you have the logos\n",
      "and that's where you could put the R_R_ , Real Reaction .\n",
      "<vocalsound> <vocalsound> But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of um , b or we'd like the the button size on this .\n",
      "So basic remote operation runs as follows ,\n",
      "we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator ,\n",
      "um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source ,\n",
      "whatever power-source we've actually determined we want .\n",
      "They suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power ,\n",
      "Um I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works ,\n",
      "We can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , you know ,\n",
      "very specific to the customer .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um certain restrictions do apply here though .\n",
      "And uh so you <gap> functions what <disfmarker> for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves .\n",
      "Um the manufacturing division also has said that um <vocalsound> they have several types of chips\n",
      "and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise .\n",
      "Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip .\n",
      "Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before ,\n",
      "and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition .\n",
      "um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for <disfmarker>\n",
      "So , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , Jill ,\n",
      "I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme <disfmarker> do we program the responses and the questions .\n",
      "I feel like voice recognition would be , I don't know , w it would be too hard to really <disfmarker>\n",
      "If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology <disfmarker>\n",
      "But , I guess , we have to look at w what <vocalsound> our production cost is for the chip itself anyway .\n",
      "let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . Um .\n",
      "It's not gonna be a huge universal remote .\n",
      "'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons .\n",
      "If we do a voice-activated locator , though , we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip .\n",
      "Honestly , I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base\n",
      "I think if we had a a locating device with the small one , I think that seems way more advanced .\n",
      "Okay , so what kind of material do we want to be made out of ?\n",
      "I don't think wood is a viable option .\n",
      "'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium ,\n",
      "I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm\n",
      "not sure that we'll have the time and money to <vocalsound> produce a whole array of\n",
      "uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex ,\n",
      "because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour .\n",
      "um we could do f a cherry cover for this year\n",
      "So we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could <vocalsound> give two latex covers to start .\n",
      "Are we gonna go with the voice activated <disfmarker>\n",
      "I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost , you know .\n",
      "because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time .\n",
      "Uh and what size batteries , double A_ , triple A_ ?\n",
      "or we could do one small lithium ,\n",
      "I ki I kind of <vocalsound> like your idea about the retro phone dial ,\n",
      "'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are ,\n",
      "because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ?\n",
      "which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side ,\n",
      "Well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side .\n",
      "Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that .\n",
      "I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though ,\n",
      "or if we're going for the retro look , I think , like a really shiny black would be cool .\n",
      "or like a gun-metal grey ,\n",
      "I'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button .\n",
      "It'll wear off . <vocalsound>\n",
      "so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be .\n",
      "Like a little cut-out kind of <disfmarker>\n",
      "Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow .\n",
      "The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design ,\n",
      "the U_I_D_ the user interface design .\n",
      "I think you're going to get a lot of , I mean , the final say on what buttons get put <disfmarker>\n",
      "'Kay . And you're gonna do some product evaluation .\n",
      "Okay , and right now , the I_D_ and U_I_D_ , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay .\n",
      "Okay . Um here's the agenda for our last meeting .\n",
      "Um after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation ,\n",
      "then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote .\n",
      "Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process ,\n",
      "let's have the prototype presentation .\n",
      "<vocalsound> The base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided ,\n",
      "and it's gonna be plastic .\n",
      "Um then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red .\n",
      "Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue , almost see-through .\n",
      "The whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it <disfmarker> just that one button will light up .\n",
      "Um and then at the bottom we have our logo .\n",
      "And then on the side you have the buttons .\n",
      "and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of ,\n",
      "I think you did an awesome job .\n",
      "I don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about .\n",
      "Feel good meaning what ?\n",
      "Physically ,\n",
      "Yeah , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it .\n",
      "Okay so , we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale ,\n",
      "do we feel it's very easy to use ?\n",
      "Two . That's what I say .\n",
      "Okay , fashionable ?\n",
      "I mean like no , I think it's very fashionable .\n",
      "I'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way .\n",
      "Mm I don't think it's that fashionable .\n",
      "does it feel good ?\n",
      "And it's i it is very ergonomically designed .\n",
      "Alright , average is two .\n",
      "Is it technologically innovative ?\n",
      "does it have voice <disfmarker> I mean the phrase recognition on it ?\n",
      "We could do it with the chip , yes .\n",
      "And there's no way you can represent it on here . Y\n",
      "so I'd probably give it a three .\n",
      "But it is just a T_V_ remote .\n",
      "It's just trendy , basically .\n",
      "It's capable of being squishy and fruity .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner ,\n",
      "Okay , so now uh we're moving on to finance ,\n",
      "Um it's not hand dynamo , it's powered by battery , so we give it a <disfmarker>\n",
      "Do I just put quantity being one battery , or <disfmarker>\n",
      "this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s ,\n",
      "Oh , let's just go for a lithium .\n",
      "And special colour .\n",
      "We're really having just push-button interface .\n",
      "button supplements <disfmarker> the buttons are no\n",
      "Um they're uh they're a special form , 'cause they're indented .\n",
      "Mm . Well , we're under cost then .\n",
      "We've got eleven point two .\n",
      "So we can go to production .\n",
      "Now we're gonna talk about the project process\n",
      "We think we got stifled for cri <vocalsound> creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote , initially .\n",
      "We didn't have a whiteboard .\n",
      "Oh , overall I mean I thought we did a good job like <disfmarker>\n",
      "minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it .\n",
      "and we've all been a pretty congenial team here , I think .\n",
      "And no internet .\n",
      "Yeah , digital pens .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I really appreciated those , yeah .\n",
      "The use of the laptops for receiving everything .\n",
      "but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only .\n",
      "I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs .\n",
      "and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary ,\n",
      "w welcome to the the first meeting of uh Real Reaction's uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control .\n",
      "taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh <vocalsound> uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand\n",
      "and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody ,\n",
      "uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company .\n",
      "um <vocalsound> I'll just go round th the table ,\n",
      "Andrew , marketing ,\n",
      "um m Kendra with the uh um <disfmarker> designing the the the User Interface\n",
      "uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design . Um .\n",
      "ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want ,\n",
      "uh everybody has a contribution to make\n",
      "if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background\n",
      "in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly\n",
      "my name's Andrew\n",
      "I'm a <disfmarker> I'm the Market Research person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control\n",
      "and uh yeah I'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design ,\n",
      "what people want to <gap> like <disfmarker> and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I'm Kendra\n",
      "and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and um <vocalsound>\n",
      "I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before\n",
      "<vocalsound> Uh I'm Katie ,\n",
      "I'm the Industrial Designer\n",
      "and I'll just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control\n",
      "I don't want to make this meeting too structured\n",
      "because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank .\n",
      "uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else\n",
      "um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do .\n",
      "The the remote control needs to be original ,\n",
      "there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have\n",
      "um and that goes along with being trendy , uh uh you know the I want it uh scenario .\n",
      "User-friendly\n",
      "as as we all know , remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly\n",
      "And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money ,\n",
      "The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh what it uh what it must actually do ,\n",
      "the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer\n",
      "and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production .\n",
      "Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board\n",
      "and uh uh <vocalsound> let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here , um <disfmarker>\n",
      "In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires , that we don't do that , um\n",
      "everybody knows what whiteboard is\n",
      "so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal ,\n",
      "but le let's go round the table ,\n",
      "Um , badger . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um probably a duck\n",
      "Uh 's horses ,\n",
      "I think homo sapien\n",
      "and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh <disfmarker> we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um ,\n",
      "we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros\n",
      "so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet\n",
      "and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent .\n",
      "<vocalsound> It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make .\n",
      "would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls .\n",
      "I think <disfmarker> I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons\n",
      "and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well .\n",
      "Um , but that <disfmarker> it's easy to <gap> if you can switch back and forth instead of having to <vocalsound> press a bunch of different buttons\n",
      "so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled\n",
      "and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use ,\n",
      "Or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ?\n",
      "Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think it's important that you should be able to <disfmarker> when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere\n",
      "and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself\n",
      "Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with T_V_ players and <gap> T_V_s and D_V_ players , like they aren't\n",
      "they're very boring ,\n",
      "making a a stylish remote control would be a very like <disfmarker>\n",
      "Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um . Something that looks looks <disfmarker> doesn't look like remote control .\n",
      "I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> people won't see it as a remote control\n",
      "I think something that's comfortable to hold\n",
      "because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things\n",
      "so something that's more comfortable\n",
      "that fits in a person's hand better .\n",
      "<gap> remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it\n",
      "whereas if you want <gap> <disfmarker>\n",
      "could all be flat\n",
      "that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see , like a mouse button .\n",
      "I mean <vocalsound> the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh\n",
      "fi find the button buttons easily .\n",
      "But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them <disfmarker> be kind of down\n",
      "must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons ,\n",
      "I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all .\n",
      "Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something\n",
      "we could have parallel marketing s schemes\n",
      "where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable\n",
      "it's it's like uh it's one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device ,\n",
      "I think it's <disfmarker> this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room\n",
      "They they just need to be very very dependable\n",
      "because people sort of take them for granted\n",
      "it needs to be very effective , very <disfmarker> always dependable . Uh\n",
      "but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um , it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah .\n",
      "most <disfmarker> I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey ,\n",
      "I was just thinking of um <vocalsound> what they're doing with mobile phones now\n",
      "how you can get the different um <disfmarker> what are they called ? Like the face-plates\n",
      "I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that ,\n",
      "so people can get different different things .\n",
      "Again I don't think that's ever been done before ,\n",
      "but uh <vocalsound> maybe thinking of that , it's <disfmarker> considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing <disfmarker> like a second campaign to market new facials for your <disfmarker> to your <disfmarker> might go a bit astray\n",
      "since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one\n",
      "you could come up with like novelty ones ,\n",
      "I think we've got um a good idea now .\n",
      "Needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly .\n",
      "we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail .\n",
      "Um then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes\n",
      "and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised .\n",
      "welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> I'll briefly go through the uh notes of the of the last meeting\n",
      "we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour .\n",
      "Um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items ,\n",
      "that switching was easy ,\n",
      "that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular ,\n",
      "um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting ,\n",
      "that the keys might be concave ,\n",
      "Um should have interchangeable fascias\n",
      "um illuminated\n",
      "Um and that people might want it as as <disfmarker> in addition to their existing remote controls .\n",
      "And that it shouldn't be too small ,\n",
      "mm that it it gets lost . Um .\n",
      "I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations .\n",
      "Uh before I do that , however , I will go through some new project requirements\n",
      "that um <disfmarker> the the management have placed on us\n",
      "Um the uh the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this\n",
      "and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought .\n",
      "the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet .\n",
      "Um and and they want it only to cover televisions .\n",
      "what is not q quite clear from their directive is\n",
      "whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext\n",
      "or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , D_V_D_s , um satellite boxes ,\n",
      "which uh <disfmarker> I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise .\n",
      "The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours .\n",
      "Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R_s in grey against uh a yellow background .\n",
      "this doesn't <vocalsound> necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market .\n",
      "Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly ,\n",
      "but uh um we we need to talk that through .\n",
      "these are functionality requirements from the <disfmarker> our our guys down in the the research lab .\n",
      "Took hundred people\n",
      "and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are <disfmarker> how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes .\n",
      "See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly .\n",
      "Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it .\n",
      "Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user .\n",
      "I kinda take that to mean as um <vocalsound> they they don't uh <disfmarker> they , yeah , they only use <disfmarker> they only work for the television\n",
      "as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ .\n",
      "Uh again , seventy five percent is <disfmarker> seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot .\n",
      "fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons ,\n",
      "we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext ,\n",
      "but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the <disfmarker> uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used\n",
      "So I think maybe fewer buttons ,\n",
      "which also make the design look sleeker ,\n",
      "frustrations of like people losing remote control .\n",
      "maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_\n",
      "it would have to incorporate <gap> , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control .\n",
      "Maybe like it'll beep or something .\n",
      "the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is <disfmarker>\n",
      "And uh repetitive strain injury ,\n",
      "I suppose we should make it more comfortable\n",
      "like I was saying about the whole mice <disfmarker> the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable .\n",
      "Maybe don't even have to hold it as such .\n",
      "It also asked um if we would <disfmarker> if people would pay more for speech recognition\n",
      "and younger people say they would .\n",
      "And uh there was another section on our <disfmarker> on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays ,\n",
      "but the data wasn't there ,\n",
      "I must say that um the uh <disfmarker> I c can't remember what <vocalsound> um f you know phone service I was using the other day ,\n",
      "but that had sorta speech recognition\n",
      "which worked uh remarkably well ,\n",
      "And uh <vocalsound> it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you <disfmarker> <vocalsound>\n",
      "possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design .\n",
      "I've got some other things\n",
      "I couldn't fit onto this presentation .\n",
      "Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used .\n",
      "like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine ,\n",
      "but it's not frequently used .\n",
      "Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance\n",
      "is used the most .\n",
      "I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use .\n",
      "Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings ,\n",
      "And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily <disfmarker>\n",
      "uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ?\n",
      "you could have the most <vocalsound> used buttons on top\n",
      "like the one that like slides back\n",
      "and the buttons are concealed underneath .\n",
      "If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um <vocalsound> remove them altogether .\n",
      "I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition ,\n",
      "what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups .\n",
      "Forty <disfmarker> no sorry <disfmarker> for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent .\n",
      "again , we don't know the relative proportion <disfmarker> the relative numbers in the age groups .\n",
      "If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it .\n",
      "the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls .\n",
      "But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ <disfmarker>\n",
      "You could just put it down once on top your T_V_\n",
      "and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are ,\n",
      "I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television ,\n",
      "because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself ,\n",
      "so it probably needs to be um <disfmarker> possibly actually need a button on it\n",
      "Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use .\n",
      "w we need to s identify things that <vocalsound> people actually need\n",
      "and and it's a function of frequency and relevance .\n",
      "<disfmarker> if we can design something that that looks interesting ,\n",
      "um incorporates the the logo and and the colours\n",
      "and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's <gap> the yellow and grey , um\n",
      "buttons or or buttons as an option .\n",
      "Uh you were saying about um it could <disfmarker> technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed <disfmarker>\n",
      "we could maybe have like an activation\n",
      "if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say\n",
      "I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote .\n",
      "Do you want to just carry on with <disfmarker>\n",
      "I was just kinda wrapping up there .\n",
      "eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better ,\n",
      "take out the limited functio functions\n",
      "but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away .\n",
      "S s we could <disfmarker> we could make it dual function <gap> voice recognition and <gap> still have buttons on it um\n",
      "this is just about the technical functions .\n",
      "the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products\n",
      "and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas\n",
      "Um and then there are two different kinds that I found .\n",
      "There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one\n",
      "these are the two different ones .\n",
      "This one um <disfmarker> this is the user centred ,\n",
      "it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons\n",
      "and then this is the engineering centred ,\n",
      "which has a lot more buttons ,\n",
      "what a remote control is is you <disfmarker> it's to send messages to the television set ,\n",
      "turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that .\n",
      "And so for this product it's gonna be television only ,\n",
      "and then it has to have the uh logos\n",
      "for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use\n",
      "and has quite a <disfmarker> you know , fewer buttons .\n",
      "Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television\n",
      "and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top ,\n",
      "then that would be easier .\n",
      "the unique style , maybe have it light up\n",
      "um the changeable face-plates ,\n",
      "when we were talking about havi losing it ,\n",
      "maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it <disfmarker> maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that ,\n",
      "rather than the uh the the traditional <disfmarker>\n",
      "Um something like this shape ,\n",
      "sort of something that you can <disfmarker> that's sort of a more vertical shape ,\n",
      "uh uh uh l uh l such as <disfmarker> I mean um something you hold up like that ,\n",
      "possibly with a couple of buttons like that ,\n",
      "again the <disfmarker> n need to look at the the the technicalities of um\n",
      "if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as I say , r know , really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum ,\n",
      "possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off . Um and nothing else .\n",
      "I'll just do my presentation on the working design uh .\n",
      "Uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ player or whatever .\n",
      "Um and it does this uh by <disfmarker> well , you need <disfmarker> to start off you need an energy source <vocalsound>\n",
      "and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip\n",
      "and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote\n",
      "um which will then be sent to the uh the television , the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do .\n",
      "Um and you need a user interface ,\n",
      "which controls the chip and thus the messages\n",
      "and uh the user interface is <disfmarker> that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source , <vocalsound> uh some sort of user interface ,\n",
      "which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that .\n",
      "Um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver .\n",
      "This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for .\n",
      "my personal preferences <disfmarker>\n",
      "I I just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out ,\n",
      "uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery\n",
      "or a battery dock you could place it in ,\n",
      "so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you .\n",
      "Uh also definitely a user-friendly interface <vocalsound>\n",
      "um and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it ,\n",
      "I think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one .\n",
      "Um I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls , particularly sort of independent ones .\n",
      "you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in ,\n",
      "Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control ,\n",
      "the the the battery will last\n",
      "know , five , ten years .\n",
      "uh uh p perhaps we should , know , reduce the uh , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment\n",
      "Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ?\n",
      "it's actually a marketing gimmick .\n",
      "it's uh it's totally practical .\n",
      "Uh so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um\n",
      "uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by , you know , magnetic waves or whatever ,\n",
      "It could have like uh <disfmarker> know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time .\n",
      "I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there ,\n",
      "'Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies . <vocalsound>\n",
      "what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery ?\n",
      "Uh . That sounds pretty good , yeah .\n",
      "Do they make batteries that last that long ?\n",
      "but there are certainly things that you buy . I mean calculators for example .\n",
      "Yeah , they have that little solar <disfmarker>\n",
      "Most of them , don't they have sort of a combination of the two ,\n",
      "when there is light , they'll work off the light ,\n",
      "and if there isn't , they'll kick into this battery ,\n",
      "so we can maybe do something like that\n",
      "I mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating\n",
      "I would think is i is is probably , you know , no more than minutes in its entire life .\n",
      "like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used , channel selection a hundred and sixty eight\n",
      "That does sound excessive .\n",
      "We're looking at extreme simplicity .\n",
      "We're looking at a radically different shape .\n",
      "Possibly no buttons at all um ,\n",
      "but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design , then then that's fine .\n",
      "Um I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition\n",
      "um and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control , volume control and on off .\n",
      "Um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo , uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme\n",
      "and <vocalsound> there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable uh covers . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> Yeah . We are doing just the television .\n",
      "are we doing just the television\n",
      "so not D_V_D_ players ,\n",
      "I think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given ,\n",
      "we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting ,\n",
      "Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group .\n",
      "Um I'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly\n",
      "Um they've got lots of buttons on them\n",
      "that uh people don't use\n",
      "Um and people lose them .\n",
      "um <vocalsound> that we're <disfmarker> <vocalsound> we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons ,\n",
      "and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use .\n",
      "um <vocalsound> we want to go for uh a long lasting battery\n",
      "and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A_ um as uh a trendy remote control , and and B_ as uh a Real Reaction product .\n",
      "again um , I'll <disfmarker> we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you\n",
      "and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision .\n",
      "Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are um what energy source we want to use ,\n",
      "And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply , then basically it's uh sealed for life\n",
      "um <disfmarker> and uh this is where I need uh uh Kate's expert advice\n",
      "um d d do we go for a custom designed chip ?\n",
      "Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward\n",
      "and we'll we'll finalise those uh da today .\n",
      "Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface ,\n",
      "Uh and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design ,\n",
      "Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it\n",
      "and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation .\n",
      "And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at .\n",
      "I'll just be talking about the components design .\n",
      "basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do .\n",
      "Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command\n",
      "and then this is translated uh into uh light signals\n",
      "which are then seen by the T_V_ .\n",
      "Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at <disfmarker> uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery\n",
      "and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator , uh two more resistors and a capacitor\n",
      "and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . Um . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command\n",
      "and this creates a a connection within the the remote\n",
      "the chip then senses this connection\n",
      "and produces a signal in a Morse code format .\n",
      "This signal's sent to the transistor\n",
      "and then sends it on to the light emitting diode\n",
      "which is then trai changed into a infrared light\n",
      "as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons .\n",
      "Uh y the fewer buttons you have , I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . Um\n",
      "however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult\n",
      "Also we have to work within the company constraints ,\n",
      "and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons\n",
      "and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it .\n",
      "Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use ,\n",
      "so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery\n",
      "and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf ,\n",
      "and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility\n",
      "and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon .\n",
      "Um , however that's gonna cost more ,\n",
      "but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper\n",
      "but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like uh voice activation ,\n",
      "so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip .\n",
      "inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive .\n",
      "Do we do we know uh by how much ?\n",
      "I don't actually have any price information ,\n",
      "And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip .\n",
      "a lot longer than an off the shelf chip .\n",
      "I think we need to make a a decision here .\n",
      "Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply ,\n",
      "that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology .\n",
      "Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands ,\n",
      "for example if you um can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten\n",
      "and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one\n",
      "Once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's pretty much the the world <disfmarker> the the sky is your limit ,\n",
      "given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling .\n",
      "speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you ,\n",
      "Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive ,\n",
      "given that the um the technology is not well developed\n",
      "and and given that it's it's never been done before ,\n",
      "uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons ,\n",
      "maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost .\n",
      "I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing .\n",
      "Anyway , I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it .\n",
      "it will have voice recognition um uh\n",
      "so I did some research on the internet\n",
      "the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users ,\n",
      "um commands and mechanisms for the operation ,\n",
      "and there're just kind of a variety of choices .\n",
      "Um findings ,\n",
      "a lot of times they tend to look cluttered\n",
      "and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual .\n",
      "There're some special ones available , like this one right here ,\n",
      "which is marketed towards children , um different designs ,\n",
      "and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume\n",
      "<vocalsound> Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like <vocalsound> .\n",
      "just kind of minimise the clutter ,\n",
      "avoid too many buttons\n",
      "and also um <vocalsound> one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse ,\n",
      "that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side ,\n",
      "I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple , cheap and reliable .\n",
      "I think they're they're about the same cost really .\n",
      "there's a lot of slide buttons out there .\n",
      "Okay , fair enough , fine .\n",
      "for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down\n",
      "so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down\n",
      "So three three <disfmarker> there's three buttons on a slider .\n",
      "The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to n s know , okay , this is just the volume and this is the channel .\n",
      "'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa ,\n",
      "so it'd be kinda good to have them be <disfmarker> feel completely different .\n",
      "like the shape of it almost like a mouse ,\n",
      "we have to come up with is the the actual shape\n",
      "so we we're looking at sliders for both a <disfmarker> uh volume and channel change\n",
      "I was thinking kind of just for the volume ,\n",
      "in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the <disfmarker> that for rolling ,\n",
      "this is my report on trend watching .\n",
      "The data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer .\n",
      "And we got reports from Paris , Milan on new fashions .\n",
      "And uh the most important aspect is the l the look\n",
      "<disfmarker> it has to look fancy , look and feel\n",
      "uh instead of the current functional look and feel .\n",
      "I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect ,\n",
      "which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it .\n",
      "and the third being easy to use is probably a given ,\n",
      "I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those .\n",
      "from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera .\n",
      "clothes , shoes and furniture\n",
      "and uh a spongy material to be used on the <vocalsound> on the outside .\n",
      "that's different , certainly .\n",
      "if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through .\n",
      "But fashions do don't last very long .\n",
      "that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things ,\n",
      "like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year\n",
      "and uh whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates ,\n",
      "we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it\n",
      "Also means you can drop it without damaging it .\n",
      "depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? Instead of having a ten year guarantee ?\n",
      "With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out .\n",
      "it's like the old Swatch watch\n",
      "where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those ,\n",
      "'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion ,\n",
      "I <disfmarker> I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one ,\n",
      "I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , you know , a long time .\n",
      "Um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better .\n",
      "What if we included the batteries in the cover ?\n",
      "Oh yeah . I like that .\n",
      "That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers\n",
      "I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it <disfmarker> y you've then got the connection\n",
      "whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , you know , completely soldered together\n",
      "um and , you know giving people the option of buying a new uh <disfmarker> a a complete new thing ,\n",
      "the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't <disfmarker> it doesn't have a cover on at all , it will still work um totally .\n",
      "Um then if , you know , if people lose the cover , I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote .\n",
      "that that's just it with the covers , you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product .\n",
      "it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item .\n",
      "Um and , you know , as as external fashions change , then we get new new covers on the market and , you know , readily available .\n",
      "like they have for mobile phones\n",
      "that are just fruits and animal prints and colours .\n",
      "the fashions apply to furniture ,\n",
      "It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me .\n",
      "And you know , th the the design that I've got , and and it could be a a home-made design , um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control ,\n",
      "I mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably , two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else ,\n",
      "um w we need to decide on the <disfmarker> just the basic shape of the thing .\n",
      "And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route ,\n",
      "and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana ,\n",
      "but um know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look ,\n",
      "t to deliberately get away from the uh um <vocalsound> uh you know , the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes\n",
      "and , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . Um\n",
      "'cause there's certainly you know , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed\n",
      "I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow\n",
      "yellow seems a bit of a strong colour\n",
      "I mean we're we're we're simply <disfmarker> it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um .\n",
      "I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um <vocalsound> a shape that's almost like a mouse .\n",
      "because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand\n",
      "um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape\n",
      "but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and\n",
      "my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape\n",
      "so that you can just sort of ho hold it .\n",
      "you'd want it narrower than a mouse though\n",
      "'cause it <disfmarker> a mouse you're kinda just resting on it ,\n",
      "you want something you can definitely grip .\n",
      "so it's <disfmarker> you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , you know , and fiddling with the buttons .\n",
      "kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this ,\n",
      "and then it widens up top\n",
      "And then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light , the infrared light at the T_V_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume\n",
      "and the power could be wherever , up up the top or something .\n",
      "Um I'm just <disfmarker> I'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much <disfmarker> how good it's gonna be to change channels\n",
      "I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ?\n",
      "I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes .\n",
      "we need the the manual controls\n",
      "we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff ,\n",
      "but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice .\n",
      "my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway um .\n",
      "you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons .\n",
      "if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and <disfmarker> or do voice commands ,\n",
      "and <vocalsound> either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness\n",
      "I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available .\n",
      "We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume .\n",
      "if we if we're going down that route , then we need some sort of display .\n",
      "But the television would be the display\n",
      "We actually use the television , okay . Okay , okay , okay .\n",
      "like you hit menu\n",
      "and menu will come up on television\n",
      "so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select .\n",
      "I think we've actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um .\n",
      "Kate and Kendra now go away\n",
      "and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough ,\n",
      "Um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh <disfmarker> I was gonna say concrete ,\n",
      "and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control .\n",
      "Our energy source is gonna be\n",
      "for simplicity of , you know , manufacturing and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um ,\n",
      "and um <vocalsound> make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh we'll say at least five five ten years\n",
      "And interchangeable case ?\n",
      "I i interchangeable case seems to be um <vocalsound> um important to the concept .\n",
      "Um it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections .\n",
      "i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want , then uh <disfmarker> I mean uh uh this is totally new .\n",
      "We d we don't know whether\n",
      "that <disfmarker> to what extent people do it or not ,\n",
      "but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway ,\n",
      "so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets ,\n",
      "And uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or <disfmarker>\n",
      "no ,\n",
      "because we've got so few buttons\n",
      "that it <disfmarker> that actually makes that redundant .\n",
      "<disfmarker> cer certainly wider angle than than current ,\n",
      "so that if you're holding it , you know , anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh <vocalsound> you know , i i it will work most of the time um .\n",
      "I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing , then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh .\n",
      "we're all clear where we go from here .\n",
      "thank you very much indeed\n",
      "and I'll s see you all again in thirty minutes .\n",
      "Welcome to the <disfmarker> what should be the last of these meetings\n",
      "the um th the the minutes of the last meeting uh I think we'll take those as read , um <disfmarker>\n",
      "the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes\n",
      "and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance\n",
      "and then uh uh just tidy up with production\n",
      "we basically have the same kinda lay-out here\n",
      "you hold it like this\n",
      "and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically .\n",
      "Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume ,\n",
      "on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda <disfmarker>\n",
      "so you can hold it and scroll ,\n",
      "or you can hold it and and push .\n",
      "Uh this is the power key ,\n",
      "um it's kinda like the biggest\n",
      "Uh that's the little menu key .\n",
      "This is the infra-red section\n",
      "Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands\n",
      "so you can you know talk to it like that\n",
      "Um the logo is down down there um\n",
      "and <gap> has the cover on it\n",
      "the red bit's the cover\n",
      "and it kinda goes over everything\n",
      "and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . Um .\n",
      "And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic ,\n",
      "just kind of a light <vocalsound> non-descript grey\n",
      "and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers ,\n",
      "so they kinda just stretch over .\n",
      "spongy like is something that people wanted\n",
      "and it just sort of stretches over\n",
      "But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers\n",
      "and then the buttons come through\n",
      "each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ .\n",
      "<gap> for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically\n",
      "we could broaden the <disfmarker> broaden it out a bit\n",
      "but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger\n",
      "if we just lengthen it I guess\n",
      "so it comes down to the base of the hand\n",
      "<vocalsound> The final product would actually stand up , yeah <vocalsound> .\n",
      "I think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on\n",
      "let's have a look at the um f finance .\n",
      "if I <gap> get the uh spreadsheet up .\n",
      "this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design\n",
      "and I I I've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us ,\n",
      "for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour ,\n",
      "we're just simply on batteries ,\n",
      "the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that um\n",
      "we're <vocalsound> we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with\n",
      "and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around\n",
      "that I don't think is a a serious problem .\n",
      "The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive\n",
      "but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design\n",
      "so that that has to stay .\n",
      "Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves\n",
      "Um it's simply made of plastic\n",
      "so th that's uh that's no problem\n",
      "we haven't actually got a scroll wheel\n",
      "we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um <vocalsound> slider\n",
      "I do don't know that they're special colour .\n",
      "the the costings uh come in at <disfmarker> exactly on target at twelve point five\n",
      "uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different\n",
      "that um <vocalsound> any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers\n",
      "if the management expect us to be techno <gap> again <gap> fail again <disfmarker> technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give ,\n",
      "I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . Um .\n",
      "Andrew do you want <disfmarker> what do you want to say about um the uh yeah the evaluation\n",
      "Method of evaluation <vocalsound> testing the product was to just <gap> if it met all the criteria <disfmarker> all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management .\n",
      "what I've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard\n",
      "um gauge our team response to these questions .\n",
      "on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false .\n",
      "And then at the end just take an average\n",
      "look at these questions .\n",
      "Is the device f flashy and fashionable ?\n",
      "I think most definitely .\n",
      "I'd say definitely a one yeah .\n",
      "and also uh technologically innovative ?\n",
      "Yeah , defi yeah , yeah\n",
      "the voice technology indeed .\n",
      "Easy to use ?\n",
      "I don't see we could've made it any easier .\n",
      "Uh suitable for the consumer ?\n",
      "I think it made <disfmarker> we met all of the consumer\n",
      "Uh is it complicated ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> Uh functional ?\n",
      "Yeah definitely .\n",
      "<gap> found easily .\n",
      "We've b built in the the speech , where are you , function .\n",
      "Does it take long to learn to use ?\n",
      "No , not at all .\n",
      "The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Less buttons\n",
      "<gap> it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um will device appeal to all age groups ?\n",
      "I think it will\n",
      "because I mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so <disfmarker>\n",
      "we had the we had the data <gap> saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money\n",
      "but the funct the increased functionality , <vocalsound> the e ease of use of the device might make up for that .\n",
      "I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups\n",
      "I think we can reasonably say it's another another one ,\n",
      "<gap> in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement\n",
      "it's it's simple to use ,\n",
      "um it's it's it's within budget ,\n",
      "I I think we've done an amazing job\n",
      "one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven .\n",
      "Eleven divided by <vocalsound> eleven's one so <vocalsound> equals average of one .\n",
      "No .\n",
      "I think we worked well together\n",
      "and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make\n",
      "seemed to discuss things pretty well\n",
      "th this this slide here I mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity ,\n",
      "I think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows .\n",
      "Um I won't comment on leadership ,\n",
      "uh teamwork I think we've uh <disfmarker> I think everybody's uh worked pretty well together .\n",
      "Um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens ,\n",
      "and new ideas found , um , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh\n",
      "uh a new approach .\n",
      "Um are the costs within budget ?\n",
      "Yes .\n",
      "Is the project evaluated ?\n",
      "We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria , um\n",
      "Thank you very much indeed ,\n",
      "Cool , thank you <vocalsound> ,\n",
      "So I call the meeting closed .\n",
      "Um this is the kick-off meeting for the day .\n",
      "Um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction .\n",
      "As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting ,\n",
      "um become acquainted with each other ,\n",
      "um have a little training on tools ,\n",
      "uh create a plan ,\n",
      "discuss things\n",
      "and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total .\n",
      "The new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly .\n",
      "That , Steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness .\n",
      "The originality um is gonna take all of us .\n",
      "Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at <disfmarker> for some marketing research information from you , Sarah .\n",
      "we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design .\n",
      "Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard .\n",
      "Kate , why don't you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , I guess <disfmarker>\n",
      "we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well ,\n",
      "'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around .\n",
      "you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I think it's to get us used to using the pen .\n",
      "Not a mouse , a rat .\n",
      "a fish .\n",
      "And I think your pen's running out of whatever .\n",
      "we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this\n",
      "and this remote control has to be sold <disfmarker> um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros ,\n",
      "with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros .\n",
      "That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale .\n",
      "would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million .\n",
      "Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item .\n",
      "if they cost twelve and a half , you're selling it for twenty five , you're making twelve and a half Euros each .\n",
      "Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million ,\n",
      "I was just wondering if that's the um <disfmarker> If fifty percent is normal <disfmarker>\n",
      "Um I would think would be more like sixty percent .\n",
      "you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that .\n",
      "In order to make fifty million Euros , and you're only getting twelve and a half each <disfmarker>\n",
      "four million . You'd have to sell four million .\n",
      "Experience with a remote control .\n",
      "Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something ?\n",
      "That that that's the sorta product we're talking about , one that will work for a <disfmarker> in a home environment , for a T_V_s and <disfmarker>\n",
      "I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time ,\n",
      "but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated\n",
      "and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another .\n",
      "that you always sit around <disfmarker> you know , you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something , there's five different remotes , and one for the D_V_D_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else .\n",
      "And they don't always talk to each other .\n",
      "But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television .\n",
      "We could make a Hello Kitty\n",
      "themed remote .\n",
      "I think one in b bright colours would be good . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think one that works would be good . <vocalsound>\n",
      "We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation .\n",
      "I mean there's also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great <vocalsound> products .\n",
      "I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions .\n",
      "Like I've got one at home\n",
      "that has well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume ,\n",
      "you know , subtitles , mute , there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do , like <vocalsound> .\n",
      "that's a really good point ,\n",
      "because I think one of the things that <disfmarker> being somewhat computer literate , we tend to um go to menus and then make choices ,\n",
      "so if it's like an uh volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume .\n",
      "We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down .\n",
      "Mm . We can make it smart like an iPod ,\n",
      "make everything menus .\n",
      "closing the meeting .\n",
      "Um I know this sounds like it was very quick ,\n",
      "I think that's the industrial design is the first one ,\n",
      "that's Kate , for the working design .\n",
      "And user , that's you S Steph , for the technical functions design ,\n",
      "and for marketing the user requirements specification .\n",
      "we have to help each other\n",
      "and work through this as a group ,\n",
      "Uh as it says , we're gonna get individual instructions ,\n",
      "and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now\n",
      "Welcome to this second meeting .\n",
      "This is a meeting on functional design .\n",
      "Um I did <disfmarker> took the minutes from the first meeting\n",
      "and I'll show them to you in a moment .\n",
      "Um I know each of you have a presentation\n",
      "and um in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes ,\n",
      "um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion ,\n",
      "because there's <disfmarker> I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements\n",
      "and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have .\n",
      "for the minutes of the first meeting .\n",
      "the product was developed uh and reviewed ,\n",
      "and we talked about the financial end of it .\n",
      "Um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese .\n",
      "Did I miss something ?\n",
      "we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well .\n",
      "as a group I think we've <disfmarker> are <disfmarker> they're accepting the minutes .\n",
      "Um , then we'll move to the three presentations .\n",
      "One of the the biggest issues I found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls\n",
      "and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar <disfmarker> of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you .\n",
      "my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context\n",
      "and to think about menu functionality and current technology\n",
      "Um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now ,\n",
      "and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard .\n",
      "And if we devote some energy into this , I think the um recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players <disfmarker> although it makes immediate sense to <vocalsound> have our remote control interact with these ,\n",
      "I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools .\n",
      "again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls .\n",
      "fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons .\n",
      "eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy .\n",
      "Could <disfmarker> can I ask where these figures come from ,\n",
      "Um it was market research\n",
      "and there were a hundred people in the room ,\n",
      "so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money .\n",
      "in between , as the Project Manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be\n",
      "um that teletext is outdated um\n",
      "and the internet is coming in as important ,\n",
      "but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_\n",
      "um with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan .\n",
      "an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question .\n",
      "these market research uh uh questionnaires <vocalsound> looked into your your uh concern about technology\n",
      "and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition .\n",
      "the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it ,\n",
      "the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them <vocalsound> would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control .\n",
      "I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if <disfmarker> and you know , the the designers ,\n",
      "but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five <disfmarker>\n",
      "I mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested ,\n",
      "In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ?\n",
      "I don't know if speech recognition should be um should be included ,\n",
      "I think that maybe shows more about uh being open to technology .\n",
      "Uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research\n",
      "on like how much more it would be\n",
      "and any , you know , existing examples ,\n",
      "How d I'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things .\n",
      "I I I uh did not receive any information on that ,\n",
      "but I think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important ,\n",
      "because um there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen\n",
      "and and that wasn't responded to ,\n",
      "but uh some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> But I think the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology\n",
      "that's looking at age groups .\n",
      "and I'm making and I'm making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar <disfmarker> younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people . Or comfortable ,\n",
      "I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control\n",
      "and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is uh up to the designers .\n",
      "technical functions design .\n",
      "I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah . I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions .\n",
      "my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have .\n",
      "And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition ,\n",
      "that's not something I'd thought about at all ,\n",
      "Um and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , T_V_ remote control .\n",
      "these are two models of existing remote controls .\n",
      "Uh the one on the left seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control .\n",
      "It has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies .\n",
      "It also has <disfmarker> seems to have channel up and channel down ,\n",
      "Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right ,\n",
      "which has <disfmarker> it also has play , stop and pause and everything ,\n",
      "I don't think we need them at all .\n",
      "I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down\n",
      "and I think an an enter function where you can access <disfmarker> it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . Uh\n",
      "not related to the internet one that you mentioned ,\n",
      "because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do .\n",
      "I was thinking something <disfmarker> some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access .\n",
      "Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech um recognition possibility .\n",
      "But we could go back to the pictures of the <disfmarker> uh , what're they called ? The pictures of the remote controls\n",
      "and possibly discuss what we think about them ,\n",
      "I think the white <disfmarker> that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered , <vocalsound> <disfmarker>\n",
      "The the style of these is terrible .\n",
      "not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , just every e yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised . <vocalsound>\n",
      "that's that for now .\n",
      "I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid\n",
      "and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work .\n",
      "I've been doing a little bit of web-based research ,\n",
      "But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design\n",
      "that I'd like to discuss with you .\n",
      "let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is .\n",
      "It's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface\n",
      "which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit\n",
      "that actually composes the message um based on what the <disfmarker> which buttons the user presses ,\n",
      "we turn that into a message ,\n",
      "um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver .\n",
      "we want an energy source\n",
      "And we've got to think about what that might be .\n",
      "Uh typically it would be a battery ,\n",
      "but I'm open to suggestions . <vocalsound>\n",
      "then we have the the user interface .\n",
      "And the main components in there are the the th the chip\n",
      "that translates button presses into a message ,\n",
      "and sends the message to the receiver .\n",
      "what what does it look like ?\n",
      "What do the buttons look like ?\n",
      "That's where the user interface is really coming into its own .\n",
      "The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there ,\n",
      "or um what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ?\n",
      "Um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ?\n",
      "I may be wrong here ,\n",
      "but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device .\n",
      "Um and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing ,\n",
      "I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea ,\n",
      "but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need <disfmarker> gonna need to hit .\n",
      "Do we have um ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ?\n",
      "Um , I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna <vocalsound> give me some advice on that , if you're asking me ,\n",
      "It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced ,\n",
      "Although what what uh suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries\n",
      "Could it be possible to have uh , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an M_P_ three player does ? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever .\n",
      "You could <disfmarker> you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours ,\n",
      "and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages ,\n",
      "and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries ,\n",
      "which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you <disfmarker> then it has a place .\n",
      "And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa .\n",
      "<vocalsound> But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not .\n",
      "I uh think that's a very interesting idea ,\n",
      "and I don't know much about what these things cost .\n",
      "it's better than my idea about solar , probably . <vocalsound>\n",
      "solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night ,\n",
      "It would have to sor store up the energy\n",
      "M yeah , that would be too heavy\n",
      "and it'd cost too much .\n",
      "but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably <disfmarker> I mean it might cost more to <disfmarker> at first to develop and to install ,\n",
      "but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer\n",
      "do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ?\n",
      "Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in .\n",
      "And the dock could look very fancy\n",
      "Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range .\n",
      "Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ?\n",
      "so that we'd be looking for the younger end .\n",
      "but I think you raised some good questions\n",
      "about are there enough of these people out there ,\n",
      "or are they making purchasing decisions ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they they may be buying um , you know , personal music devices and all that ,\n",
      "are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> It might be good to know\n",
      "um uh who , you know , who's actually buying televisions\n",
      "Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ?\n",
      "We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it .\n",
      "That's probably more what it is .\n",
      "<vocalsound> We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day ,\n",
      "Um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions .\n",
      "Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive .\n",
      "Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys .\n",
      "It has to have big user-friendly buttons\n",
      "and sh n <vocalsound> definitely we wanna be inspired\n",
      "that the current <vocalsound> styles are just plain awful .\n",
      "I have a chart here that I didn't include . Um\n",
      "Um actually we're , you know , we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes ,\n",
      "so we have to get close to finishing . <vocalsound>\n",
      "my only comment is I think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only <disfmarker> just really in terms of streamlining .\n",
      "Enter , power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key .\n",
      "H how does that work ?\n",
      "how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ?\n",
      "if you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on ,\n",
      "and so maybe um when you press power , initially it turns it on ,\n",
      "press power again and use that as an enter um <disfmarker>\n",
      "Then you'd have to have an off te off key .\n",
      "I was thinking maybe you <disfmarker> to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession ,\n",
      "It's not getting a bit complicated ?\n",
      "Or something that has a a turning dial , where at the far end is on or off . <vocalsound>\n",
      "It's definitely channel , volume , power .\n",
      "things like screen settings and audio settings , I would generally do them on the actual television itself ,\n",
      "like here you have a you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself .\n",
      "As you said , you know , don't make it too hard for the granny . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Um <gap> will be completed q questionnaire ,\n",
      "um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um\n",
      "and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together .\n",
      "Um your individual assignments are for um Kate to do the components ,\n",
      "for you , Steph , to do the user interface\n",
      "and for you the trend-watching .\n",
      "Um and each of us will get help from our coach .\n",
      "Then that's the end of this meeting .\n",
      "We didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though .\n",
      "I think I went over the functions\n",
      "and wrote them down\n",
      "Um that's what I went over and nobody was objecting to them .\n",
      "could you reiterate the new project requirements ,\n",
      "Um the teletext is outdated ,\n",
      "it's only to be for a T_V_\n",
      "and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan um\n",
      "is that the yellow and black ?\n",
      "It doesn't tell me .\n",
      "I'll just use it from their website .\n",
      "this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting .\n",
      "Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting ,\n",
      "the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point .\n",
      "Um and we should each have a presentation to make .\n",
      "Um we have certain decisions to make\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um there are the decisions we have to turn to ,\n",
      "but we'll come back to them in a minute\n",
      "after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting .\n",
      "Um Sarah , you presented a marketing research report\n",
      "um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition .\n",
      "And then Steph did a second presentation\n",
      "um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use .\n",
      "Kate presented a working design of <disfmarker> going after <disfmarker> going over the basics on the whiteboard\n",
      "um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost .\n",
      "Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries\n",
      "and having a docking place as a selling point .\n",
      "we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers .\n",
      "Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ ,\n",
      "Um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for .\n",
      "Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics .\n",
      "Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed .\n",
      "first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up ,\n",
      "which was uh current cost of the competition devices ,\n",
      "and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros , depending on uh branding .\n",
      "But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for , we're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market .\n",
      "I investigated the remote control market in greater detail ,\n",
      "and my uh <disfmarker> the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch .\n",
      "What's hot ,\n",
      "fruit and veg . Spongy .\n",
      "And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . <vocalsound>\n",
      "This is really interesting change from past years ,\n",
      "because it is much more organic ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset .\n",
      "on um <vocalsound> what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing .\n",
      "Fancy .\n",
      "Functional is out .\n",
      "And f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , I'm I'm thinking polished , elegant , <vocalsound> you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above .\n",
      "This is twice as important as the next finding ,\n",
      "which is technologically innovative .\n",
      "This is interesting ,\n",
      "'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important ,\n",
      "but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically <vocalsound> superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances .\n",
      "Ease of use . Again , pretty low ,\n",
      "I mean it's the top three ,\n",
      "but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important .\n",
      "I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of <vocalsound> fruit <vocalsound> fruit themed sleeves .\n",
      "It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone .\n",
      "I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . <gap> you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy .\n",
      "initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear .\n",
      "They could be interchangeable ,\n",
      "they're spongy ,\n",
      "So what we're talking about is changing . this concept .\n",
      "Everyone has a T_V_ remote ,\n",
      "but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the <disfmarker> someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers .\n",
      "So I really open this up to uh any other feedback . This <vocalsound> spongy fruit and veg .\n",
      "I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this .\n",
      "Spongy is gonna be difficult , I'm afraid .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And as for as for um well budgeting as well , if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components .\n",
      "we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber .\n",
      "I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy ,\n",
      "I was thinking titanium myself .\n",
      "I have been influenced by pictures of iPods ,\n",
      "I think many of us would associate those with fancy .\n",
      "it would be uh a a very simple product\n",
      "that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . So <disfmarker>\n",
      "Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management\n",
      "W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit ,\n",
      "I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next .\n",
      "I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone .\n",
      "you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you ,\n",
      "I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate ,\n",
      "and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division ,\n",
      "who have told me what's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got ,\n",
      "this is the innards of a remote control um .\n",
      "and that's the the back of the interface .\n",
      "And this is a push-button one ,\n",
      "so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons\n",
      "that go through onto the the board at the back\n",
      "and they push these buttons here .\n",
      "that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate .\n",
      "We got to have something that pushes the little buttons\n",
      "that um talk to the chip\n",
      "that encodes the message\n",
      "that sends the the message to the receiver .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source .\n",
      "Um we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment .\n",
      "We can have a hand <disfmarker> <vocalsound>\n",
      "a wind-up , yeah ,\n",
      "but i it maybe is <disfmarker> doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg .\n",
      "<vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source ,\n",
      "where um <vocalsound> you you actually get the energy by moving the device ,\n",
      "Or we we had talked about solar power ,\n",
      "but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark .\n",
      "I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case .\n",
      "It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , <vocalsound> or titanium .\n",
      "Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber ,\n",
      "and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface ,\n",
      "but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that .\n",
      "what does the interface look like ?\n",
      "push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Um we can have scroll buttons\n",
      "and the the scroll button can incorporate a push ,\n",
      "so you can have it like on a mouse\n",
      "where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that\n",
      "and push to select something .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um you can have multiple scroll buttons ,\n",
      "And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote ,\n",
      "but this will increase the cost . <vocalsound> <vocalsound>\n",
      "Um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced ,\n",
      "If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons .\n",
      "Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons .\n",
      "And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices .\n",
      "I don't know what that is ,\n",
      "but I think they think it's quite important\n",
      "I I think we've got two options .\n",
      "We can either go for a really cheap model ,\n",
      "keep all of the costs down ,\n",
      "Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer ,\n",
      "I think it , um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> but it could have an L_C_D_ screen\n",
      "and it could have multiple scroll buttons ,\n",
      "and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Um do you have any idea if if this could <disfmarker> if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ?\n",
      "I'm afraid I don't have that information available .\n",
      "Um manufacturing didn't actually give <disfmarker> attach any prices to any of this , I'm afraid .\n",
      "so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it .\n",
      "I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company .\n",
      "That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise .\n",
      "We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one ,\n",
      "which would allow um say a banana ,\n",
      "but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface ,\n",
      "I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says ,\n",
      "just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations ,\n",
      "which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things .\n",
      "Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones ,\n",
      "um what functions we actually need ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel ,\n",
      "but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right .\n",
      "It has uh scroll wheels without without a display ,\n",
      "So I was thinking that uh <vocalsound> um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um\n",
      "and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen .\n",
      "and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment ,\n",
      "you can scroll along\n",
      "and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen .\n",
      "Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote ,\n",
      "um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press ,\n",
      "but still quite simple and quite cost effective .\n",
      "what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably ,\n",
      "I was thinking , yellow and black ,\n",
      "just because that's the company's colours ,\n",
      "with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , <vocalsound> just small along the bottom\n",
      "Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea .\n",
      "And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber .\n",
      "I mean titanium would be great ,\n",
      "but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey .\n",
      "If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too futuristic .\n",
      "we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately .\n",
      "Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea ,\n",
      "But as for actually arranging them <disfmarker> let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one .\n",
      "And I quite like it ,\n",
      "'cause it's just smooth and hand-held\n",
      "and it's got these easily reachable buttons\n",
      "so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . Up , down , left , right .\n",
      "Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ?\n",
      "I I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll ,\n",
      "like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . And enter in the middle ,\n",
      "and when when you click on each one , it <disfmarker> you can go into a new menu for that .\n",
      "I think I think that's a g nice clean design ,\n",
      "But they all have this this feature of this uh <disfmarker> It's not quite a scroll wheel , but it's a kind of selection in this circle ,\n",
      "But we can implement it with simple push buttons ,\n",
      "either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , <vocalsound> uh and then also <vocalsound> when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down .\n",
      "So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle .\n",
      "<vocalsound> It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic ,\n",
      "Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? And have it abstract .\n",
      "we could call <vocalsound> like a fruit name ,\n",
      "Mm . We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather <disfmarker> if you feel <disfmarker> if you like the spongy <disfmarker>\n",
      "I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so <disfmarker>\n",
      "Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention\n",
      "This is actually the volume up and down ,\n",
      "but <vocalsound> they both say V_ on them ,\n",
      "so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these .\n",
      "But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down .\n",
      "If we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions .\n",
      "Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things .\n",
      "They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use ,\n",
      "which <disfmarker> the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar .\n",
      "You were saying that the kinetic would be useful ,\n",
      "um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . Um\n",
      "or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it .\n",
      "unfortunately I don't have costing information .\n",
      "I i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic ,\n",
      "What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ?\n",
      "I've used kinetic in terms of watches\n",
      "you don't even notice um that it's there .\n",
      "I've never come across it before ,\n",
      "but it sounds fantastic .\n",
      "it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient .\n",
      "a good selling point .\n",
      "So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible .\n",
      "But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision .\n",
      "Um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique\n",
      "um and I would certainly recommend it , I think ,\n",
      "Um what about the case ?\n",
      "I think they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber ,\n",
      "and I think we've discussed not having titanium .\n",
      "Um we've sort of eliminated wood .\n",
      "We said plastic or rubber .\n",
      "Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy Yeah , s thick spongy cover ,\n",
      "I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible ,\n",
      "but I agree , it's uh <disfmarker> sounds like a nice idea if it is .\n",
      "Um the next part they want is the user interface concept .\n",
      "Then I'll just say I support either <disfmarker> from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that .\n",
      "like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen .\n",
      "I'd <disfmarker> like push buttons with <disfmarker>\n",
      "Um this is gonna sound weird ,\n",
      "but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes .\n",
      "And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design ,\n",
      "Marketing they want product evaluation .\n",
      "Um the look and feel design is for Kate ,\n",
      "uh Steph gets the user interface design ,\n",
      "you get product <vocalsound> evaluation .\n",
      "Um the two of you <vocalsound> get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype .\n",
      "Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way .\n",
      "And that's the end of this meeting .\n",
      "Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting ,\n",
      "for us to go over the previous minutes ,\n",
      "then for the two of you to present your prototype\n",
      "and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria .\n",
      "We then have a finance aspect ,\n",
      "And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my ,\n",
      "um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation .\n",
      "So we're going to make a very fast track .\n",
      "um each of you made your presentations .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations .\n",
      "The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy .\n",
      "Um we decided chip on print would be used .\n",
      "Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus ,\n",
      "powered by kinetic energy .\n",
      "There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight .\n",
      "Um looking like a scroll ,\n",
      "but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use ,\n",
      "Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product\n",
      "Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us .\n",
      "and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints\n",
      "Um we're down to the prototype presentation .\n",
      "well you see ,\n",
      "each made one ,\n",
      "This is the one that I made .\n",
      "It is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons .\n",
      "This is like a scroll ,\n",
      "but they are push buttons\n",
      "and they enter <disfmarker> takes you into the different menus .\n",
      "And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there .\n",
      "the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right <vocalsound> in the different menus .\n",
      "The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple ,\n",
      "lack of uh buttons all over the place .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held ,\n",
      "Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit ,\n",
      "but I think we have two different options ,\n",
      "because we did make a another one ,\n",
      "which wa uh is in the shape of banana ,\n",
      "if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana ,\n",
      "which is also nice\n",
      "and easy to hold\n",
      "and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology ,\n",
      "just a slightly different design .\n",
      "uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic .\n",
      "Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one <disfmarker>\n",
      "uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons .\n",
      "we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints .\n",
      "colour , I think <disfmarker> I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons ,\n",
      "but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well .\n",
      "maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them .\n",
      "I don't have very much to add .\n",
      "The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic .\n",
      "We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two ,\n",
      "We have simple rubber push buttons\n",
      "I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped .\n",
      "This one has no obvious connections to fruit ,\n",
      "it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie ,\n",
      "you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ?\n",
      "I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the\n",
      "Breaking ,\n",
      "that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it ,\n",
      "I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role .\n",
      "Yeah , <gap> we really like we really like that design ,\n",
      "And it's a very simple design ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I mean actually how to program the menus\n",
      "and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen ,\n",
      "This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation ,\n",
      "this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers\n",
      "a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise .\n",
      "I'm going to go and use the whiteboard ,\n",
      "and I've made a list of criteria to look at ,\n",
      "but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria ,\n",
      "fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other .\n",
      "And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms ,\n",
      "some of them seem rather close ,\n",
      "what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials .\n",
      "We'll put price up at the top .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Not that we actually know anything about it ,\n",
      "wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ?\n",
      "It depends what what you mean by fancy really ,\n",
      "I'd call these quite uh minimalist ,\n",
      "a plain , simple , clean design .\n",
      "it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality ,\n",
      "I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy ,\n",
      "<gap> like stylish or aesthetic .\n",
      "in terms of elegant , fancy . we'll call it E_F_ um , do we do we think that perhaps <disfmarker> and maybe we should say the yellow ?\n",
      "they're both yellow with black buttons ,\n",
      "but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black .\n",
      "So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two\n",
      "but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff ,\n",
      "I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana .\n",
      "And of the two I really like I m I like the banana ,\n",
      "that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now ,\n",
      "I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true .\n",
      "It's more true than false , about a two .\n",
      "<vocalsound> technologically innovative .\n",
      "I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative .\n",
      "we'll say <disfmarker> we'll say uh false .\n",
      "Easy to use .\n",
      "<vocalsound> One ,\n",
      "trendy , s <vocalsound> and I say specifically spongy fruity .\n",
      "maybe only a two or a three then ,\n",
      "we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific <disfmarker>\n",
      "We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy .\n",
      "Yeah , I don't really think that's gonna work ,\n",
      "two ? Um\n",
      "are there excess buttons ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> <vocalsound> That is false .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons .\n",
      "Better , more intuitive buttons , yes .\n",
      "Ugly .\n",
      "No . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I think they're different ,\n",
      "it is quite it is quite quirky I think .\n",
      "It could be quite a good brand , like a good little object .\n",
      "uh could we say it's cost saving ?\n",
      "we also need tho think about the energy .\n",
      "Is it the kinetic energy ?\n",
      "it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy .\n",
      "but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet ,\n",
      "do you have any idea about price or other features ?\n",
      "I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop .\n",
      "So true one\n",
      "I would say maybe a two ,\n",
      "And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these\n",
      "instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive\n",
      "and then make that true ,\n",
      "'cause I have to do an average . <vocalsound>\n",
      "And then um excess buttons .\n",
      "Just putting no excess buttons .\n",
      "so it doesn't ruin the polarity .\n",
      "see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative ,\n",
      "because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons .\n",
      "I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition\n",
      "but but we are at the upper end of the push button market . <vocalsound>\n",
      "let me know if if any of these <disfmarker> um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here <disfmarker> if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features .\n",
      "If not I'll average those .\n",
      "and the next big thing is the finance .\n",
      "and I'll uh figure out the average here .\n",
      "Thank you for everyone's help with that .\n",
      "And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet\n",
      "it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device .\n",
      "Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells .\n",
      "just kinetic then , <gap> .\n",
      "Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those .\n",
      "'cause we've just got push buttons ,\n",
      "and we only need one of those .\n",
      "the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve .\n",
      "It looks like it <gap> single curve ,\n",
      "What does double curved mean , I don't understand .\n",
      "I I think you <disfmarker> it means you reverse the curve .\n",
      "you can do a banana in single curve ,\n",
      "case material supplements . Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour .\n",
      "I just wanna say plastic .\n",
      "We had the special colour .\n",
      "I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself ,\n",
      "Okay . We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added\n",
      "Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black .\n",
      "And the buttons <disfmarker> Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ?\n",
      "does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ?\n",
      "'Cause I think they can be plastic .\n",
      "Yeah . They could be plastic ,\n",
      "we don't have to have rubber buttons ,\n",
      "Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed .\n",
      "More profit .\n",
      "go to the project evaluation , next slide .\n",
      "the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity .\n",
      "leadership ,\n",
      "Sure .\n",
      "teamwork ,\n",
      "means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things .\n",
      "Yeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought . <vocalsound>\n",
      "'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder .\n",
      "we went over all those things\n",
      "and we're satisfied with all the above .\n",
      "Um did we find any new ideas ?\n",
      "I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I <disfmarker> that really opened my eyes .\n",
      "Spongy .\n",
      "And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before ,\n",
      "Good work as a design team ,\n",
      "I'm not sure all the wires are really great though .\n",
      "Are the costs within the budget ?\n",
      "Oh yes .\n",
      "Is the project evaluated ?\n",
      "I can give you a number ,\n",
      "the average evaluation score is one point eight eight ,\n",
      "There were six true or ones ,\n",
      "two s almost true or close to true ,\n",
      "and then uh one false , seven points ,\n",
      "And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology ,\n",
      "which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works ,\n",
      "Yes .\n",
      "And we've therefore <disfmarker> we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary ,\n",
      "I have a final report to present ,\n",
      "um and then we're done .\n",
      "I believe that is the end of our meeting .\n",
      "Welcome to the meeting everyone .\n",
      "This is the first meeting uh for developing our , our new product .\n",
      "<gap> I'm Heather , I'm your Project Manager .\n",
      "If everyone could go around and explain their role and um , and their name .\n",
      "My name's Poppy .\n",
      "I'm the Industrial Designer for this project .\n",
      "<vocalsound> My name's Tara and I'm the User Interface Designer .\n",
      "I will also be responsible for the functional design phase , the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I'm Genevieve .\n",
      "I'm the Marketing Expert .\n",
      "And uh tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today ,\n",
      "um um as well as planning the project ,\n",
      "as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control .\n",
      "Um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy ,\n",
      "um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer .\n",
      "And , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , can't see the numbers as well ,\n",
      "Yes , it's a television remote control .\n",
      "I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now .\n",
      "and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use .\n",
      "Same with conceptual design and detailed design .\n",
      "And , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , I , I'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal .\n",
      "My favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay ,\n",
      "right now it is an elk .\n",
      "and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature ,\n",
      "I'm gonna take minutes\n",
      "while , um , you guys express your favourite animals .\n",
      "like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . <vocalsound>\n",
      "But I like cats because they're so independent ,\n",
      "I think my favourite animal would be a dog ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> . Um , I like dogs because , um , they're so good to humans ,\n",
      "I'm going to draw a butterfly ,\n",
      "because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving .\n",
      "So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard ,\n",
      "um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget ,\n",
      "um , wanna make this um <gap> selling price of twenty five Euros .\n",
      "we can <disfmarker> like the price to create it will be significantly less .\n",
      "Um , we'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million Euro .\n",
      "Um , and make it for an international market .\n",
      "Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents .\n",
      "so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ?\n",
      "So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um suggestions that you may have so far ,\n",
      "I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing .\n",
      "I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing .\n",
      "So maybe if you could have some kind of\n",
      "tracking <vocalsound> device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was .\n",
      "Do yous not find that , um , <vocalsound> like , there's a lot of , um , buttons on your remote control , and you don't know what half of them do .\n",
      "There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something .\n",
      "Are we going into kind of novelty factors here .\n",
      "I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing .\n",
      "And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original .\n",
      "Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times .\n",
      "Um , our next meeting will be in half an hour .\n",
      "Industrial Designer .\n",
      "You'll be beginning your , your working design .\n",
      "Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes .\n",
      "and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag\n",
      "Marketing Expert .\n",
      "Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour .\n",
      "welcome back fro to the second meeting .\n",
      "the first presentation we'll be looking at is Poppy's presentation .\n",
      "I will take this time just to apologise .\n",
      "I , I only , uh , received my emails later on . 'Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing ,\n",
      "Um , so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design ,\n",
      "Uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique .\n",
      "Um , one is the visibility in the dark ,\n",
      "And we could use illuminated buttons ,\n",
      "Or we could use fluorescent materials\n",
      "Um , also we could use um an alarm .\n",
      "So if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press ,\n",
      "Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design .\n",
      "Um , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory .\n",
      "So they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal .\n",
      "So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart .\n",
      "So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled ,\n",
      "I mean , the user would return the p product to the company ,\n",
      "'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made .\n",
      "Would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ?\n",
      "One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector .\n",
      "Um , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company ,\n",
      "Um also there is um components .\n",
      "But I haven't put this plan together yet .\n",
      "This would actually show the circuit diagram .\n",
      "Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet .\n",
      "I it just shows what sort of energy source .\n",
      "It could be a battery ,\n",
      "And , um , the next presenter will be Tara .\n",
      "There're two functional design options .\n",
      "A multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices .\n",
      "And a single function remote control , used specifically for the television . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing .\n",
      "A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices .\n",
      "Um , I think that a single function remote control would be preferable ,\n",
      "It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable .\n",
      "And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic .\n",
      "And less functions would have to be included .\n",
      "So it would be cheaper to make .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ?\n",
      "Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ?\n",
      "Um , <vocalsound> I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing .\n",
      "And that would probably , um , I d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design .\n",
      "because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , um , we're gonna go over budget for one thing .\n",
      "And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design .\n",
      "Okay . So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control .\n",
      "Um , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um , and some internet research .\n",
      "and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose .\n",
      "So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products .\n",
      "Um , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics .\n",
      "Um , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . Not just in electronic fashion .\n",
      "Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media ,\n",
      "Um , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly .\n",
      "Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy .\n",
      "Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user .\n",
      "Um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot .\n",
      "Um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons .\n",
      "so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons .\n",
      "And another thing with um lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable ,\n",
      "And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used .\n",
      "Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour .\n",
      "Teletext , um , now I'm not too clear on what that is .\n",
      "it's just information that um , like television timetables , what's on , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and <disfmarker>\n",
      "Um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five .\n",
      "So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control .\n",
      "Remote controls are often lost somewhere .\n",
      "Um , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ .\n",
      "But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well .\n",
      "So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting ,\n",
      "and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into .\n",
      "So it m it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway .\n",
      "And something that might further complicate it is that the T_V_ makes noise itself .\n",
      "We need to decide if that is our um intention is , is a simplistic design .\n",
      "Um an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working .\n",
      "It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next .\n",
      "Might be quite expensive to do that though .\n",
      "Um , I think our priority really should be unique design .\n",
      "so uh in my opinion it should be , um , user-friendly and unique .\n",
      "Um , I th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off .\n",
      "I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff .\n",
      "But if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe\n",
      "stick to the basics .\n",
      "Um , so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more .\n",
      "Before we go into uh more discussion on <gap> we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions .\n",
      "Um , for one thing , because <disfmarker> Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . Um , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function .\n",
      "Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway .\n",
      "Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now .\n",
      "So , um , all the remote controls must have our um <disfmarker> We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way .\n",
      "but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour ,\n",
      "It's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Um , so , now we need to discuss , um and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be .\n",
      "Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ?\n",
      "So no L_C_D_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition .\n",
      "I don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your T_V_ , you'd want to be able to use it ,\n",
      "It was a management decision ,\n",
      "so it's , it's pretty much out of our hands at this point .\n",
      "Um , well I guess , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons .\n",
      "I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had .\n",
      "Would you be able to , um , put the little device anywhere ?\n",
      "so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something .\n",
      "It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller .\n",
      "Would it need a battery then ?\n",
      "So , mm , more research into that one .\n",
      "um , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , um is a go ahead .\n",
      "Um right , if w if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger .\n",
      "I just thought that <gap> it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up .\n",
      "Um , so like big b um buttons , <gap> for people you are visually impaired .\n",
      "We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material .\n",
      "I guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you're s and then it goes ,\n",
      "Um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again .\n",
      "That's probably feasible .\n",
      "Um , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ?\n",
      "Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ?\n",
      "Because it might , for , for our design purposes , I mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour .\n",
      "it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark .\n",
      "So we've decided on lighting up things .\n",
      "Yeah well , I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control .\n",
      "So I I dunno if there's something that diff , you know like five different face plates .\n",
      "and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well .\n",
      "You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on .\n",
      "I think that we should incorporate that .\n",
      "Um , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again .\n",
      "We'll have to do more research .\n",
      "Well , welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design .\n",
      "on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design .\n",
      "And , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what uh materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing .\n",
      "The meeting will be forty minutes long .\n",
      "And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter .\n",
      "Um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made ,\n",
      "Um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source .\n",
      "Um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of .\n",
      "Um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip .\n",
      "Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ?\n",
      "they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced .\n",
      "so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well .\n",
      "Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source .\n",
      "We could use a basic battery ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago .\n",
      "Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed .\n",
      "Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power .\n",
      "Um , or there's solar power ,\n",
      "which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful .\n",
      "Um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat .\n",
      "We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up .\n",
      "we could use metal ,\n",
      "we could use rubber\n",
      "which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ .\n",
      "Um , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really .\n",
      "Um right our choice for buttons as well .\n",
      "with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons .\n",
      "they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons .\n",
      "Um one thing with the scroll buttons though .\n",
      "we would have to have an L_C_D_ um\n",
      "and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult .\n",
      "Um , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with .\n",
      "<vocalsound> My personal preferences ?\n",
      "I think we could go for the kinetic energy source .\n",
      "It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor ,\n",
      "And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels .\n",
      "Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics .\n",
      "And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple ,\n",
      "Another thing is it might be more difficult <disfmarker> if it's a rubber exterior <gap> talking about putting on interchangeable plates .\n",
      "Maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case .\n",
      "So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable .\n",
      "you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just <disfmarker> it's protective as well .\n",
      "So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber .\n",
      "is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ?\n",
      "As far as I know . It should be .\n",
      "Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack .\n",
      "Like as a backup for something .\n",
      "you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors ,\n",
      "but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power .\n",
      "May maybe that could be the backup .\n",
      "I think that might be a little impractical though .\n",
      "Like if the kinetic thing , I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy .\n",
      "Um , I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now .\n",
      "Uh , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is .\n",
      "Um , there are two types of user interfaces .\n",
      "There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output\n",
      "and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control .\n",
      "I'm not really sure about the pictures that <disfmarker>\n",
      "maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "Um , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard ,\n",
      "so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard .\n",
      "So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics .\n",
      "Like an L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "But if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that .\n",
      "It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume .\n",
      "It'd be more a command interface ,\n",
      "No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control ,\n",
      "I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway ,\n",
      "to make it more simplistic .\n",
      "We , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , um , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons ,\n",
      "that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful .\n",
      "It can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming . <vocalsound>\n",
      "But what about the lighting up effect ?\n",
      "Um , well , um , I thought we had um decided that we would <disfmarker> if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up .\n",
      "I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards .\n",
      "I'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through .\n",
      "So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something .\n",
      "and well rubber is a more translucent product too ,\n",
      "so we have that taken care of .\n",
      "Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ?\n",
      "'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons .\n",
      "I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing .\n",
      "this report is about uh trend-watching .\n",
      "And the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy .\n",
      "um of course , as <disfmarker> we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting ,\n",
      "and I'd like to stick to that .\n",
      "The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us .\n",
      "Um , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that .\n",
      "Yeah , it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring .\n",
      "<vocalsound> It's , it's a little <gap> but it , it's everywhere .\n",
      "I think we possibly could take a more abstract design .\n",
      "Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables .\n",
      "I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something .\n",
      "I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals .\n",
      "So maybe there could be animal-based , you know .\n",
      "Energy , we've decided on kinetic , right ?\n",
      "I , I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential .\n",
      "It could even be one of our selling points .\n",
      "I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ?\n",
      "Uh , so that's the simple .\n",
      "Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting , the interior lighting system ?\n",
      "So regular chip .\n",
      "is regular not simple ?\n",
      "because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well .\n",
      "Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber .\n",
      "yeah , interchangeable plates .\n",
      "and supplements .\n",
      "What's that all about ?\n",
      "what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the <disfmarker> in consistent use .\n",
      "We haven't really decided what to do about that .\n",
      "just just the basic button functions .\n",
      "Like we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of\n",
      "So we're just going for power , channels , volume ,\n",
      "Should we have audio ?\n",
      "it's a problem with the international uh appeal , I think . Um , if we have audio\n",
      "because we don't know how other televisions work .\n",
      "'cause it , <vocalsound> mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons .\n",
      "We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic .\n",
      "And , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes .\n",
      "Um , you'll be working , Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design .\n",
      "and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in .\n",
      "And you'll be evaluating the product .\n",
      "Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay .\n",
      "And , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen .\n",
      "Um , I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect .\n",
      "seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something ,\n",
      "are you gonna come up with casing ideas ?\n",
      "Like f five different <disfmarker>\n",
      "what do yous think of this ?\n",
      "Um , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle .\n",
      "Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true .\n",
      "I guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well .\n",
      "So it's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds .\n",
      "'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then .\n",
      "Um the agenda for this meeting <vocalsound> is um <disfmarker> we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers .\n",
      "And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave gave it .\n",
      "And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget .\n",
      "It's a pretty simple design .\n",
      "It's um based on a mango ?\n",
      "And we have the company logo here\n",
      "where's the L_E_D_ ?\n",
      "It's in the middle of one of the little R_s .\n",
      "And then the other one is the power .\n",
      "So it's palm-held .\n",
      "buttons are accessible from your thumb .\n",
      "And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus .\n",
      "So one plus one would be eleven ,\n",
      "You press a plus button ?\n",
      "I've never heard of that kind before .\n",
      "but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ?\n",
      "we can further define that .\n",
      "I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five .\n",
      "like as long as we realise that's what it'll do .\n",
      "Well the there is a <disfmarker> there's a delay on remotes I think .\n",
      "um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers\n",
      "because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb .\n",
      "And <vocalsound> it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well .\n",
      "Um and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness .\n",
      "Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype .\n",
      "But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway ,\n",
      "that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use .\n",
      "Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit ,\n",
      "like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green ,\n",
      "or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in\n",
      "Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company <disfmarker> the yellow and black .\n",
      "we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device ,\n",
      "And so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances\n",
      "Do you need to do a presentation first ?\n",
      "Evaluation criteria is next in line .\n",
      "Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen .\n",
      "Um and looking looking back at my notes from our <disfmarker> both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were ,\n",
      "Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false .\n",
      "So basically the lower p the lower the points the better .\n",
      "Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ?\n",
      "We've been quite successful with the rubber coating\n",
      "The look is a little bit more playful .\n",
      "Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy ,\n",
      "I mean <vocalsound> th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen .\n",
      "I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I kinda <disfmarker> I like the potato look .\n",
      "It's a two ?\n",
      "Okay so question number two was <vocalsound> is it techn technologically innovative ?\n",
      "So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative .\n",
      "and the use of the rubber .\n",
      "and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons ,\n",
      "there's no L_C_D_ control ,\n",
      "so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway .\n",
      "we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose .\n",
      "we'll put three ,\n",
      "but I think we actually reached our goal .\n",
      "Uh , will it be easy to use ?\n",
      "Yeah . One .\n",
      "you can't really get confused with that .\n",
      "The plus number thing .\n",
      "But once that's figured out , it should be fine .\n",
      "Is this a good-looking remote ?\n",
      "Again I think the colour comes into this .\n",
      "I think that the logo could be smaller .\n",
      "Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent .\n",
      "I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand .\n",
      "where's it gonna sit in your living room ?\n",
      "the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit .\n",
      "But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand <vocalsound> .\n",
      "Would we wanna show it off to our friends ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "Okay , so should we say two for that ?\n",
      "will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ?\n",
      "I think we have to market it in the right way , that um <disfmarker> to say that it is simplistic .\n",
      "And the kinetic energy part .\n",
      "No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for ,\n",
      "About ten pounds .\n",
      "But you don't have to buy batteries .\n",
      "So in the long term this can actually save you money .\n",
      "I would give it a two still though .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user .\n",
      "I think it does very well .\n",
      "easy to use .\n",
      "Okay so one ?\n",
      "Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ?\n",
      "is the alarm system still <disfmarker> was it implemented ?\n",
      "But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm .\n",
      "I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up .\n",
      "You press the button it makes a noise\n",
      "It would just be a little speaker on the back or something .\n",
      "We can give it a one ,\n",
      "because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find .\n",
      "Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ?\n",
      "it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do .\n",
      "The plus thing needs to be worked on .\n",
      "we'll say yes it's uh one ?\n",
      "Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ ,\n",
      "I think so .\n",
      "We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about .\n",
      "Two okay .\n",
      "Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ?\n",
      "Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey .\n",
      "So it could be grey on the banana one .\n",
      "I think this is the\n",
      "the factor that we've been least successful in confronting .\n",
      "Four I think .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ?\n",
      "But maybe more like two\n",
      "<vocalsound> Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ?\n",
      "Yeah it is one point nine .\n",
      "So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing .\n",
      "Um we're using a regular chip .\n",
      "Um , it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around .\n",
      "Um , we're using plastic and rubber ,\n",
      "So it's like special colour <disfmarker> well we'll have two colours\n",
      "Well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons .\n",
      "So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros .\n",
      "I mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task .\n",
      "Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess , but m\n",
      "and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Good leadership , I think we stayed on task .\n",
      "and also our personal coach helped us along the way ,\n",
      "We never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so <disfmarker>\n",
      "I think we worked great as a team .\n",
      "We needed more Play Doh colours .\n",
      "The computer programmes are good .\n",
      "Yeah well I guess we really <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> we bounced off of each other ,\n",
      "Fantastic .\n",
      "Thank you very much . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote .\n",
      "Uh I'm Nick Debusk ,\n",
      "I'm the Project Manager .\n",
      "Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I am Corinne Whiting\n",
      "and I will be the Marketing Expert\n",
      "In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification ,\n",
      "In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching\n",
      "And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation\n",
      ", I'm Ryan .\n",
      "Um I'm the User Interface Designer .\n",
      "Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design .\n",
      "Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control .\n",
      "Um in the concept design , the user interface ,\n",
      "And the detailed design um <vocalsound> sort of like the user interface design ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> I'm Manuel\n",
      "and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um .\n",
      "In the functional design phase I'm <disfmarker> I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements ,\n",
      "um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on .\n",
      "Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product .\n",
      "And uh the detailed design <disfmarker> in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself ,\n",
      "our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . Uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing .\n",
      "we are putting together a new remote control .\n",
      "Um we want it to be something original .\n",
      "Um of course we're a <disfmarker> not only a electronics company but a\n",
      "fashion um conscious electronics company ,\n",
      "so we want it to be trendy um\n",
      "and we want it to be easy to use .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design\n",
      "let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have ,\n",
      "and then we can go into how we're gonna design it\n",
      "function of remote control is just just <disfmarker>\n",
      "change channels is its main function .\n",
      "we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or <disfmarker>\n",
      "I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ?\n",
      "I suppose you c try make it a universal remote\n",
      "But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming .\n",
      "I think they all work on the same prin principle as well\n",
      "Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em .\n",
      "So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature .\n",
      "So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh\n",
      "like a tracking device\n",
      "you could whistle\n",
      "or make a noise\n",
      "and it'd beep .\n",
      "there's a button on the T_V_ that you press\n",
      "Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance .\n",
      "so they're kinda like long and rectangular .\n",
      "Do we want something crazy ?\n",
      "we want something new that's gonna stand out .\n",
      "Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball .\n",
      "Maybe like user-friendly ,\n",
      "where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing .\n",
      "I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another <disfmarker>\n",
      "and maybe the actual controls are inside or something .\n",
      "you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time ,\n",
      "so there are always the <disfmarker> some restrictions\n",
      "Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be ,\n",
      "How sturdy is it gonna be ?\n",
      "we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room\n",
      "so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe ,\n",
      "It could be cased on the outside\n",
      "and t everything could be inside .\n",
      "we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy ,\n",
      "It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros\n",
      "goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so .\n",
      "Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association ,\n",
      "maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal .\n",
      "marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing <vocalsound> remote control out there .\n",
      "And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences ,\n",
      "Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ?\n",
      "We want it to be a b a ball ,\n",
      "I could draw sorta the ball idea .\n",
      "this is where it's connected together ,\n",
      "and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone ,\n",
      "Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it .\n",
      "I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons ,\n",
      "so maybe as simple as possible ,\n",
      "um as few buttons inside as possible .\n",
      "if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it .\n",
      "um <disfmarker> the ball is a nice idea\n",
      "because of it's stability really ,\n",
      "so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere ,\n",
      "Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's um a problem .\n",
      "but that's of course a weak point , yeah .\n",
      "I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ?\n",
      "The shape is perhaps not the most ideal .\n",
      "there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so .\n",
      "I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote ,\n",
      "it's not innovative ,\n",
      "everybody does long remote\n",
      "My idea was just to have it be kind of like a\n",
      "keyboard type shape , you know , like video games\n",
      "We could also try to do the hinge thing ,\n",
      "so it could like flip out that way .\n",
      "I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like <vocalsound>\n",
      "but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier .\n",
      "Because even <disfmarker> I suppose even with the ball\n",
      "it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah .\n",
      "So perhaps the the joystick <disfmarker> the the keyboard idea might work better .\n",
      "I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job .\n",
      "if it's small it probably looks better ,\n",
      "may not be th as functional .\n",
      "say we went with the ball the ball function\n",
      "um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um\n",
      "to make it easier to hold on to .\n",
      "But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways .\n",
      "And then we have the problem with the hinge .\n",
      "The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ?\n",
      "so then we forget the ball .\n",
      "So we've got our sort of keyboard kind .\n",
      "Question is what makes those game pads functional ?\n",
      "I think that's pretty much the form for full hand .\n",
      "So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy ,\n",
      "Except for that I think we'll not <disfmarker> probably not get a get away from some longer design .\n",
      "and <disfmarker> Batteries go weak as well ,\n",
      "Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ?\n",
      "So that either way you're pointing it it would work .\n",
      "O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so .\n",
      "but um it's rather about an instinctual thing ,\n",
      "Otherwise the design of <disfmarker> or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work .\n",
      "just to finish up ,\n",
      "should we s go with this plan ,\n",
      "it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think .\n",
      "And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want .\n",
      "And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next <vocalsound> time around ,\n",
      "We have some <disfmarker> we have some ideas and some uh\n",
      "ideas for what people want .\n",
      "let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting .\n",
      "See if I can't get things uh moving along here a little bit better .\n",
      "Um I'll go over what we went over last time ,\n",
      "Then I believe each of you have a presentation .\n",
      "Um I've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote ,\n",
      "Um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do ,\n",
      "the last meeting we went over um <vocalsound> who was responsible for what .\n",
      "I'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , uh and coming up with the final presentation .\n",
      "Um Corinne is our Marketing Expert .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> Ryan is our User Interface Designer .\n",
      "And Manuel is the Industrial Designer .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um we decided our remote ,\n",
      "uh we want it to be a universal remote\n",
      "Um we want to be modern , um fun , different .\n",
      "Uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find ,\n",
      "so we gonna have that locator function .\n",
      "Um and we want to be different .\n",
      "Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . Ball-shaped phone . The keyboard shape .\n",
      "Um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . Something we could use with one hand .\n",
      "this is my report ,\n",
      "which is going to be based pretty much on a survey\n",
      "first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research ,\n",
      "by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted .\n",
      "And then some internet research .\n",
      "I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed .\n",
      "And so I will show you some of the results from that ,\n",
      "They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls .\n",
      "And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly .\n",
      "And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy .\n",
      "I think that's definitely important .\n",
      "Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot .\n",
      "And if anyone could clarify what that means ?\n",
      "Zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ?\n",
      "Um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control .\n",
      "they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons .\n",
      "And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all .\n",
      "Of course channel selection is used the most frequently .\n",
      "And then teletext was the next . Volume and then power .\n",
      "And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used .\n",
      "I think we could definitely eliminate\n",
      "or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button .\n",
      "Um the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere ,\n",
      "and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea .\n",
      "thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote .\n",
      "And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_ . <vocalsound>\n",
      "as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they're all for it .\n",
      "From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more .\n",
      "And it kind of just went down incrementally .\n",
      "so maybe we could discuss this\n",
      "and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups .\n",
      "in conclusion . Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct .\n",
      "We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance ,\n",
      "since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control .\n",
      "Um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore .\n",
      "Uh we need to simplify the remote\n",
      "and reduce the number of buttons ,\n",
      "get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose .\n",
      "And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition .\n",
      "Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want ,\n",
      "what we should focus on . Uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Having just listened to what Corinne just said ,\n",
      "I'll draw on some of the things as well . <vocalsound> <gap> Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say .\n",
      "I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> the method I used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control .\n",
      "And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely .\n",
      "Um I had some things sent to me . Not very much .\n",
      "To look at similar devices .\n",
      "Um we discussed a universal one .\n",
      "But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it ,\n",
      "um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies .\n",
      "You have to set them , reset them to everything .\n",
      "Um and that would only add buttons .\n",
      "Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons .\n",
      "So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s .\n",
      "here here's just two pictures of remote controls .\n",
      "But one is uh user-centred .\n",
      "And you can straight away see there's less buttons .\n",
      "And the other one is <gap> engineer-centred\n",
      "where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um <disfmarker>\n",
      "and on what the <gap> have said and the market research and stuff <gap> probably looking at something that should be user-centred .\n",
      "Fewer buttons ,\n",
      "simpler to use ,\n",
      "maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe\n",
      "some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away .\n",
      "our product I think should be user interface orientated . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control ,\n",
      "the major findings <gap> market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike .\n",
      "So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend .\n",
      "Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically\n",
      "which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance\n",
      "I'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board .\n",
      "This is the basic basic premise of a remote control .\n",
      "Um the basic function is to send messages to another system .\n",
      "An energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip ,\n",
      "that can compose messages . <vocalsound> Often in the form of infrared bits .\n",
      "Um there's uh also some sound systems\n",
      "but infrared is the better or the more more used system .\n",
      "A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages .\n",
      "Um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there .\n",
      "We'll start with an energy source .\n",
      "which is usually a battery\n",
      "This energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself <vocalsound> .\n",
      "Uh which can be buttons , whatever ,\n",
      "which in fact controls a chip .\n",
      "Um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp .\n",
      "And <disfmarker> Of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface .\n",
      "The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well ,\n",
      "so that you know that it's working basically .\n",
      "The the uh energy source for one thing can be altered .\n",
      "What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp .\n",
      "We cannot change the chip\n",
      "<vocalsound> The user interface . That's something we can also discuss .\n",
      "Um as we've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment .\n",
      "Or if we just do the usual button thing .\n",
      "Or we have a touch pad or something like that <disfmarker>\n",
      "And of course the energy source . Batteries . Solar cells .\n",
      "Of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact <vocalsound> available cheap enough , developed enough .\n",
      "the more complex we make it of course , the more expensive <disfmarker>\n",
      "younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote .\n",
      "possibly it might be worth the investment .\n",
      "I think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work .\n",
      "'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o <gap> if it's on your phone .\n",
      "And you need to sort of take into light languages and then <vocalsound> different dialects I suppose as well .\n",
      "I <disfmarker> myself I find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition .\n",
      "Like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something . Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end ,\n",
      "and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over .\n",
      "Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it ,\n",
      "but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money .\n",
      "I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know .\n",
      "It's a , it's a gimmick factor that they like at first ,\n",
      "I was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements .\n",
      "Um the remote's only gonna be for the television ,\n",
      "which is good\n",
      "because we already decided\n",
      "Um no teletext . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan ,\n",
      "which is we put the fashion in electronics .\n",
      "And our corporate colours are grey and yellow .\n",
      "And we could probably get away with black too but <disfmarker>\n",
      "Um from all all three of your uh presentations , I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting .\n",
      "We want something that looks good .\n",
      "Um we want something that's simple .\n",
      "We want something that you can find easily . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of uh give or take .\n",
      "probably , I would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time .\n",
      "I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing .\n",
      "if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you wanna call it .\n",
      "But if you don't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that ,\n",
      "and that just sort of sends out a beep <vocalsound> to find where it is or something . Just by infrared .\n",
      "That'd be , that'd be good if we were going with our our ball .\n",
      "Or or with <disfmarker> you know I guess with any form that that would be good .\n",
      "that could be the charger .\n",
      "we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote .\n",
      "However , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "With the locator button .\n",
      "I guess after the meeting <vocalsound> we'll have some questionnaires .\n",
      "And uh and some summaries for for what's going on .\n",
      "Then we can come back and uh work on our individual work .\n",
      "It looks like you're already on your way for uh working with the components .\n",
      "User interface concept , we want it to be something simple .\n",
      "Um <disfmarker> Minimal number of buttons .\n",
      "I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed .\n",
      "The ball is probably not a good idea .\n",
      "Um <disfmarker> Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group ?\n",
      "if we were shooting for young guys then it's um a certain look to the remote . Or girls or older people ?\n",
      "I don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching .\n",
      "but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that .\n",
      "we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it .\n",
      "yellow it's nice and bright ,\n",
      "with the buttons being grey or black .\n",
      "And our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom\n",
      "maybe we could flare it or something .\n",
      "of course this will look like a bone then .\n",
      "it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going .\n",
      "mobile phones um they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small .\n",
      "Um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Maybe we could go with a square or something . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "with minimal number of buttons .\n",
      "I guess you've got you know one through nine . For typing in your channels .\n",
      "Uh you've got volume , up and down .\n",
      "Channel up and down .\n",
      "Power .\n",
      "Um a mute .\n",
      "A menu button , maybe .\n",
      "if we want the remote to do other things like um <disfmarker> or I guess the T_V_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into T_V_s , we just have that under one standard menu button\n",
      "press the menu button ,\n",
      "scroll up and down to select it .\n",
      "Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad .\n",
      "Would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this .\n",
      "Like a wheel on your mouse .\n",
      "if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function ,\n",
      "where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down .\n",
      "Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here .\n",
      "Then you hold it in your hand like this .\n",
      "And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the <disfmarker> or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side .\n",
      "the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here .\n",
      "You can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open .\n",
      "on a sort of side view . Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better .\n",
      "causes a problem um for left or right-handed people actually . So .\n",
      "<gap> instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person .\n",
      "Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote . <vocalsound> Special order .\n",
      "it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person .\n",
      "I mean I'm just just thinking maybe if it was um circular um with the sort of <disfmarker> that sort of <vocalsound> <disfmarker> the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that ,\n",
      "Mm . Then there's maybe another point of making it a two-in-one kind of thing .\n",
      "If we have a smaller a smaller device that actually fits into the big one .\n",
      "You give it the full functions in here ,\n",
      "and just a couple of functions in there . Like your zap zapping device is just u channels up-down , uh volume , and on-off .\n",
      "Means the big one has to be sufficiently big .\n",
      "And perhaps heavy ,\n",
      "you're watching trends\n",
      "Manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use .\n",
      "let's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two-piece .\n",
      "So one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "<vocalsound> And Ryan you work on um how how well they'll work with the us with the user . So both of those concepts .\n",
      "I gu I guess we'll take lunch in about uh half an hour .\n",
      "and then then in about half an hour after that we'll probably have another meeting .\n",
      "This is our conceptual design meeting .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes .\n",
      "Um then each of you will have your presentation ,\n",
      "um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo .\n",
      "our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users .\n",
      "Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before .\n",
      "Um which were all things we were thinking we would <disfmarker> wanna make it simple . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "And that it should look different than what's out there .\n",
      "Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it ,\n",
      "Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity .\n",
      "I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand . <vocalsound>\n",
      "And with a scrolling um function also .\n",
      "I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at .\n",
      "Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design ,\n",
      "Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative .\n",
      "And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up .\n",
      "And thirdly the remote would be easy to use .\n",
      "As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .\n",
      "Um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel .\n",
      "Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design .\n",
      "But I think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers ,\n",
      "so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and <disfmarker>\n",
      "We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further .\n",
      "We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons ,\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables .\n",
      "I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable .\n",
      "Or with exterior designs .\n",
      "So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable ,\n",
      "Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ?\n",
      "Personalise your remote .\n",
      "Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices .\n",
      "They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly .\n",
      "There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote .\n",
      "Um there's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen .\n",
      "A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response .\n",
      "Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes .\n",
      "So , then I had a look at new products that are on the market .\n",
      "Um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices .\n",
      "And then on the right is obviously an iPod ,\n",
      "and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through .\n",
      "And nothing's simpler really .\n",
      "Um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote ,\n",
      "where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before .\n",
      "So I don't know <gap> if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components ,\n",
      "Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing ,\n",
      "And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote .\n",
      "it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus .\n",
      "The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control .\n",
      "top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time .\n",
      "We are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well .\n",
      "Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell .\n",
      "So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium .\n",
      "Can also mix these .\n",
      "Um what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery .\n",
      "So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really .\n",
      "Um solar cell is interesting .\n",
      "<vocalsound> May fail though , every here and there .\n",
      "Um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem .\n",
      "You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work .\n",
      "So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery .\n",
      "our interface options are push-buttons .\n",
      "however <vocalsound> when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well .\n",
      "If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well .\n",
      "solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control .\n",
      "With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design .\n",
      "With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form .\n",
      "<vocalsound> With rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it ,\n",
      "but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit .\n",
      "Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ?\n",
      "How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ?\n",
      "Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously ,\n",
      "but uh give it like the surface of\n",
      "an orange , banana , whatever .\n",
      "You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose .\n",
      "I would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance .\n",
      "I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous ,\n",
      "So is the two piece idea out ?\n",
      "Well we sort of <disfmarker> <gap> rid of that because <gap> gonna use a battery .\n",
      "Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Energy source I think we've , I think we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet .\n",
      "Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as I said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive .\n",
      "So I guess the case would be plastic ,\n",
      "with <disfmarker> Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it .\n",
      "It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe .\n",
      "So then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ?\n",
      "Yeah I think so .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ?\n",
      "Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design .\n",
      "Corrine we'll want a product evaluation .\n",
      "And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh\n",
      "maybe and and get us a prototype .\n",
      "basically <gap> just be working on the prototype , <vocalsound> uh we'll accomplish your other two actions .\n",
      "This is our last meeting .\n",
      "Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting .\n",
      "Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation .\n",
      "Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget .\n",
      "Um then we'll do the evaluation ,\n",
      "and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make ,\n",
      "We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel .\n",
      "Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles .\n",
      "Um and a spongy feel .\n",
      "Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity .\n",
      "Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that .\n",
      "the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips ,\n",
      "um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote .\n",
      "basically we we st went with the colour yellow .\n",
      "Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana .\n",
      "These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips .\n",
      "Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel .\n",
      "And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod ,\n",
      "And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus .\n",
      "we could use the voice .\n",
      "It's as simple as you , we could make it really .\n",
      "Plastic covered with rubber .\n",
      "T the actual thing might be smaller .\n",
      "It's a quick on-off button .\n",
      "You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria .\n",
      "we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale .\n",
      "And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that .\n",
      "With seven being false , we did not achieve that .\n",
      "So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "I think it's definitely different than anything else out there .\n",
      "I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average .\n",
      "So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely .\n",
      "I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Four is fair .\n",
      "Did we make it simple for new users ?\n",
      "It's very intuitive , I think yeah .\n",
      "Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ?\n",
      "'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls <gap> most common , which are channel and volume .\n",
      "So that's a one .\n",
      "How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ?\n",
      "Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore .\n",
      "But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing .\n",
      "Y you could add an extra feature actually .\n",
      "Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television .\n",
      "That can't cost much .\n",
      "Let's add one of those features and say yes . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Are we technologically innovative ?\n",
      "It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound>\n",
      "I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um I would say we're probably at four .\n",
      "Um spongy material ?\n",
      "We have some spongy , yeah .\n",
      "It's not a one though .\n",
      "Probably a four at most .\n",
      "did we put the fashion in electronics ?\n",
      "I'd say we did .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour ,\n",
      "Now we just gotta calculate .\n",
      "Okay we'll say two point four two .\n",
      "Now we get to do the budget numbers .\n",
      "We want a fifty percent profit on this .\n",
      "Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ?\n",
      "Two .\n",
      "That's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah .\n",
      "'Kay then the case is a <disfmarker> Probably it's double curved .\n",
      "Case materials are\n",
      "Plastic .\n",
      "That's not a special colour .\n",
      "It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special .\n",
      "Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements .\n",
      "So our total is fifteen point five .\n",
      "by three Euros over .\n",
      "What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on .\n",
      "I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though .\n",
      "you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even ,\n",
      "Right . We may not need it .\n",
      "I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me .\n",
      "But I'd like to hear your thoughts .\n",
      "Uh h what did you think of our project process ?\n",
      "yeah I think we did quite well . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning .\n",
      "But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing .\n",
      "and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things .\n",
      "Super super .\n",
      "I had some problem with the pen I think ,\n",
      "Minus your PowerPoint fiasco .\n",
      "Um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary .\n",
      "And I still have to do my minutes for the last meeting . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Um so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up .\n",
      "And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that .\n",
      "we uh <disfmarker> we will wait for Anna , a few minutes .\n",
      "I think you can put anywhere you want , actually .\n",
      "It's not a directional mic , anyway .\n",
      "So I will try to get my presentation running .\n",
      "Can't help you with that .\n",
      "Alt F_ five .\n",
      "Doesn't appear on the screen here .\n",
      "It's working <vocalsound> .\n",
      "Welcome at uh <disfmarker> at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project .\n",
      "w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here .\n",
      "Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other .\n",
      "See what our roles are in this project .\n",
      "We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh <disfmarker> to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans\n",
      "w we will also try to uh to get acquainted to this tools\n",
      "Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan .\n",
      "You all know I hope <vocalsound> how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design .\n",
      "Uh then we will uh discuss\n",
      "and uh <disfmarker> wh what uh what our new product should look lite <disfmarker> like .\n",
      "basically this is about a uh a new c remote control . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "When you design a new product you of <disfmarker> uh you of course want it to be original .\n",
      "we want to be distinguished ,\n",
      "People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think , well that's the product I I need .\n",
      "So it needs to be trendy .\n",
      "But then , uh , it also should work uh user friendly\n",
      "the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase\n",
      "and uh then we will meet again\n",
      "and uh discuss this functional design .\n",
      "And the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this , the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design\n",
      "in which the the final project should get its definite shape .\n",
      "but first we will do some uh tool training .\n",
      "and we have here a a <disfmarker> a <disfmarker> a white-board .\n",
      "I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar .\n",
      "I didn't find out yet how it work ,\n",
      "Under documents in the shared folder .\n",
      "I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh .\n",
      "I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share .\n",
      "now we will try out the white-board we have here .\n",
      "Each of us is going .\n",
      "I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I'm not really sure how this works , but <disfmarker>\n",
      "shall I start ?\n",
      "I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard ,\n",
      "but they'll be recording what we write down .\n",
      "Maybe <disfmarker> maybe Anna , maybe you can start .\n",
      "Why don't you draw uh <vocalsound> your favourite animal on on th on the white-board .\n",
      "it's a dog .\n",
      "It's a horse .\n",
      "<vocalsound> A blue and black zebra <vocalsound> .\n",
      "That's <disfmarker> that's definitely a cat .\n",
      "it's a shark ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Let's continue to uh <disfmarker> to the real stuff .\n",
      "Um our project uh finance uh thing .\n",
      "Uh when we are <disfmarker> and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros ,\n",
      "more interesting for our company <vocalsound> of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro .\n",
      "to get at a international market\n",
      "Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents .\n",
      "They have to sell at least four million to make a profit <vocalsound>\n",
      "I think w when we are working on the international market , uh in principle it has enough customers\n",
      "And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control\n",
      "and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original ,\n",
      "it has to be trendy ,\n",
      "it has to be user friendly .\n",
      "Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control .\n",
      "Of course it should have a on off button . <vocalsound>\n",
      "i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control .\n",
      "We are targ targeting the television set .\n",
      "you need to record the channels .\n",
      "<vocalsound> You need to browse the <disfmarker> browse the channels in upward downward way ,\n",
      "And uh just before starting the detailed discussion , maybe we\n",
      "are the marketing guy ? Or <disfmarker>\n",
      "I'm marketing .\n",
      "And you are in the u use user interface uh design .\n",
      "And I I'm the the industrial designer\n",
      "I'm Matthew . You know . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Mael .\n",
      "Anna .\n",
      "A and I'm Nanne .\n",
      "Are there some other very important things to to do <disfmarker> well ,\n",
      "the browse function , as you m mentioned .\n",
      "And uh , you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel\n",
      "Today we have uh um teletext and all those things .\n",
      "Tomorrow you might have a some more functions\n",
      "For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up .\n",
      "But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet .\n",
      "Uh w y you two should <disfmarker> should , I think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality .\n",
      "and first before um designing the func\n",
      "thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements .\n",
      "But <disfmarker> Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels ,\n",
      "we can have all the fancy things as well\n",
      "but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use .\n",
      "Mm mm mm . Keep k keep in mind i it's a <disfmarker> it's a twenty five Euro unit ,\n",
      "so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out , I think .\n",
      "twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control .\n",
      "So we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things\n",
      "the main is browsing . Yeah .\n",
      "but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons uh that will be on it . I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting .\n",
      "Uh I would like to get this wrapped up\n",
      "you know now the basic <disfmarker> the basic things .\n",
      "just <disfmarker> just for the next meeting , um\n",
      "well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design ,\n",
      "I mean <disfmarker> so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions .\n",
      "Um you will be working on <disfmarker> on technical function design , so <disfmarker>\n",
      "And uh you <disfmarker> and you and uh uh uh well , think about requirements ,\n",
      "Does it need internet ,\n",
      "or or do do we stay at\n",
      "basic basic television uh interface .\n",
      "and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication .\n",
      "next meeting will be in uh <disfmarker> in thirty minutes uh .\n",
      "I will uh present here agenda with with with with slides to you .\n",
      "first uh just to mention I will take notes uh of this meeting\n",
      "I've also made notes of the previous meeting\n",
      "and um I was about to send them you\n",
      "but <vocalsound> then uh I had to go to this uh meeting\n",
      "So y you are the secretary also .\n",
      "Yes . Indeed .\n",
      "Then I hope you all have uh worked out <vocalsound> some some uh <vocalsound> some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting .\n",
      "Um . W We will uh in a minute we will uh <vocalsound> start with them .\n",
      "Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements\n",
      "I try to work them out ,\n",
      "they were quite abstract ,\n",
      "and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . Uh Um about the functions\n",
      "in this meeting we should really <vocalsound> try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the <disfmarker>\n",
      "You mean the social target group who we wants to target ?\n",
      "Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this ,\n",
      "And then uh we will close this meeting uh\n",
      "and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch .\n",
      "uh Anna can you c do you have a presentations ?\n",
      "I c I can talk about it\n",
      "but I have no slides or anything .\n",
      "Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it\n",
      "or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um .\n",
      "I've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group\n",
      "a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . Um .\n",
      "I've just got a web page with some data on it .\n",
      "Um basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls .\n",
      "Um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Um .\n",
      "Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy .\n",
      "Um . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user .\n",
      "Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot ,\n",
      "Uh . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons ,\n",
      "so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality\n",
      "but really most of the time they only use a small part of that .\n",
      "Do you Do you have this uh information on the web page you said ?\n",
      "I have an a web page yes .\n",
      "mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh . Uh about this .\n",
      "there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control .\n",
      "Um , power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour .\n",
      "Um , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um <vocalsound>\n",
      "and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently .\n",
      "Um . Teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour ,\n",
      "so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . Um .\n",
      "An interesting thing that this report has brought up\n",
      "is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room ,\n",
      "so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . Um .\n",
      "Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control ,\n",
      "they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps .\n",
      "Um . And thirty <disfmarker> twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ .\n",
      "I don't know how we'd go about combating that .\n",
      "Um and then it's got a demographic breakdown\n",
      "Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the <disfmarker>\n",
      "Uh I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now .\n",
      "these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design .\n",
      "and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important .\n",
      "Um , one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control .\n",
      "And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful .\n",
      "it would be all based on speech .\n",
      "Interesting idea .\n",
      "I think that would not work so well .\n",
      "You wanna have both options .\n",
      "it would it would be a solution for uh when your remote control is lost ,\n",
      "I mean when it has speech recognition then uh i then it doesn't matter where it is , my <disfmarker> well it's <disfmarker> we should be in range ,\n",
      "or maybe it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is .\n",
      "I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for <vocalsound> for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents <vocalsound> .\n",
      "And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is ,\n",
      "there is uh it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three ,\n",
      "But it's quite noisy if there is the T_V_ uh shouting .\n",
      "This is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , um .\n",
      "Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more ,\n",
      "seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five ,\n",
      "thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five ,\n",
      "um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five\n",
      "and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five .\n",
      "it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , um ,\n",
      "which we'll be talking about later I think .\n",
      "Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen\n",
      "but there's no figures apparently on that .\n",
      "I think as everybody knows uh I'm the uh Industrial Designer .\n",
      "And uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um <vocalsound> is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control .\n",
      "Um I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work ,\n",
      "the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed .\n",
      "an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip ,\n",
      "that can compose messages , usually uh through a um infrared bit\n",
      "and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages ,\n",
      "the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product .\n",
      "I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work .\n",
      "as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna\n",
      "we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control\n",
      "and I show you the the working design .\n",
      "Uh we want an on off button ,\n",
      "it's simple\n",
      "but it's it's important , and also uh <gap> the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after ,\n",
      "the components I quickly draw here ,\n",
      "in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver\n",
      "my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control\n",
      "of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver .\n",
      "what I have found and <vocalsound> after a lot of work actually I <vocalsound> I draw this I draw for you this uh schema\n",
      "<vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh that's it so I won't go into details about that\n",
      "but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And and why do you want these kind of component ?\n",
      "I mean , are they cheap ,\n",
      "or are they uh reliable ?\n",
      "and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive ,\n",
      "this one also really uh reliable\n",
      "that's it for the working design ,\n",
      "What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver ,\n",
      "can you can you get back to it ?\n",
      "the receiver is of course already in the television\n",
      "So we we must adapt to the to the receiver .\n",
      "I I suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh .\n",
      "We will use uh <vocalsound> infrared protocol uh using <vocalsound> yeah infrared\n",
      "and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists\n",
      "but we what we can do is uh uh adapting <vocalsound> the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles .\n",
      "it's just you had to change the frequencies .\n",
      "<vocalsound> But you should be careful ,\n",
      "like a guy has recently designed a remote\n",
      "uh uh uh which could switch off any other T_V_s <vocalsound> , so basically <gap> through all the things .\n",
      "we should take that into account\n",
      "I think M Mael will will consider this uh th these things .\n",
      "I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function\n",
      "so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do ,\n",
      "basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set ,\n",
      "and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons\n",
      "and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the T_V_\n",
      "as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys ,\n",
      "people are can have a speech recognition\n",
      "but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later .\n",
      "there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household ,\n",
      "you have a standard T_V_ remote\n",
      "where you have just a on , off button and play , uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option .\n",
      "And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine ,\n",
      "but <vocalsound> tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows ,\n",
      "this is the standard one with without any fancy thing\n",
      "like i it doesn't have teletext option ,\n",
      "And then you have uh what's the v video remote file\n",
      "usually it has almost all the keys over there\n",
      "but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those\n",
      "personal preferences\n",
      "I would <disfmarker> uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing\n",
      "where the <disfmarker> we could have both the uh the f a T_V_ and the remote <disfmarker> video remote control\n",
      "because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together\n",
      "How would that work ?\n",
      "so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ?\n",
      "you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing\n",
      "in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option\n",
      "in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box\n",
      "suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you\n",
      "when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program .\n",
      "In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities <vocalsound> .\n",
      "These are kind of next generation <vocalsound> functionalities .\n",
      "I mean the hard disk uh recorders uh I I've seen them in the shop .\n",
      "and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing .\n",
      "But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here .\n",
      "W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this .\n",
      "for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently <vocalsound> booming up actually\n",
      "you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list .\n",
      "I have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager\n",
      "first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions\n",
      "but it's it's getting used less and less .\n",
      "That's that's especially because of the internet of course .\n",
      "Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself .\n",
      "further yes we must think , uh do we stay uh to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back\n",
      "or do we uh uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices ?\n",
      "Um , furthermore , uh , w we need really need to interest uh <vocalsound> y younger customers\n",
      "and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty ,\n",
      "and our our current customers are mainly forty plus\n",
      "<vocalsound> younger people like trendy <disfmarker> trendy designs ,\n",
      "so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible\n",
      "but it should also be uh have a reliable image ,\n",
      "so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all .\n",
      "right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately ,\n",
      "but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys\n",
      "you press on the top , it takes one number ,\n",
      "you press on the bottom it takes another number ,\n",
      "so that you don't see two separate keys there actually\n",
      "Ma Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Mm . But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market ,\n",
      "that's the the the mm the new and the funky things ,\n",
      "there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones ,\n",
      "for example you have uh presently uh keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like uh keys like that\n",
      "How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ?\n",
      "'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all\n",
      "you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so .\n",
      "so we basically don't change the uh original order of them\n",
      "so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered\n",
      "Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group .\n",
      "Um , basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control <vocalsound> <disfmarker>\n",
      "wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ?\n",
      "So our our our remote control has to be better .\n",
      "'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control ,\n",
      "we might <disfmarker> we'll be able to <vocalsound> beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it\n",
      "they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty ,\n",
      "they have to actually need it as well .\n",
      "I think <vocalsound> many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh uh the appearance of the uh R_C_ is is important when they are buying one\n",
      "Mm . But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote .\n",
      "I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote ,\n",
      "So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance <disfmarker>\n",
      "we can't , with the price range .\n",
      "We We're not building a universal remote ,\n",
      "we're not building a high end product .\n",
      "we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R_ s R_C_\n",
      "now you know that chips are very uh cheaps\n",
      "and uh we can include it in our control some new new features .\n",
      "If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that\n",
      "I don't know . I don't know whether that's necessary .\n",
      "because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive .\n",
      "S so we can try to go in between ,\n",
      "and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated\n",
      "because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal .\n",
      "But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on .\n",
      "but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group .\n",
      "People <disfmarker> yes . Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control .\n",
      "I don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is .\n",
      "Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range ,\n",
      "uh when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money .\n",
      "Well <disfmarker> Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive .\n",
      "because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million\n",
      "then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control .\n",
      "And uh basically you can look to the standards of other <disfmarker>\n",
      "And if we want to get the market , we really need that .\n",
      "I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ .\n",
      "And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time .\n",
      "you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them .\n",
      "uh m <vocalsound> maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need\n",
      "and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content\n",
      "and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market .\n",
      "and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good\n",
      "we uh we can have lunch now .\n",
      "after lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work\n",
      "and then we have the next meeting .\n",
      "But you will be informed via the computer .\n",
      "I suggest we start the meeting uh without Matthew uh\n",
      "he's uh obviously late for some reason .\n",
      "Today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design .\n",
      "I hope uh you both did some uh some work uh concerning a uh conceptual design .\n",
      "Um this will be the uh agenda for the meeting uh <gap> .\n",
      "Uh I will take some minutes uh again .\n",
      "Um we will have the presentations of y of you different team members ,\n",
      "and then try to come to decisions uh about the concepts uh you have presented .\n",
      "we have some uh forty minutes uh to complete this uh .\n",
      "do you ha Anna do you have your presentation ready ?\n",
      "I think <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah the <disfmarker> Matthew it is it's important that Matthew yeah is here\n",
      "there is Matthew .\n",
      "this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment .\n",
      "we have to work out a way <disfmarker> what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it .\n",
      "<vocalsound> We basically used um some focus group surveys\n",
      "and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um ,\n",
      "The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really .\n",
      "The most important by far was the look and feel of it .\n",
      "It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . It needs to stand out <vocalsound> .\n",
      "It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment .\n",
      "we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out .\n",
      "That was twice as i important as the next item on here\n",
      "which is that it has to be technologically innovative <disfmarker>\n",
      "People have to then think about it and say <gap> got something there that I want . That's a really cool feature ,\n",
      "Third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect ,\n",
      "it has to be easy to use .\n",
      "So they have to be able to <disfmarker> be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um .\n",
      "Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , uh fruit and vegetables um .\n",
      "This is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , um eye-catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel .\n",
      "Um I had a talk to the design people about this ,\n",
      "but having a remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool .\n",
      "can you repeat\n",
      "and be more precise about what you just said ?\n",
      "spongy is the current thing . Spongy is the current texture ,\n",
      "but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all ,\n",
      "so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that'll be something that sets it apart ,\n",
      "rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment .\n",
      "going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables um .\n",
      "Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones ,\n",
      "a lot of them have the changeable covers ,\n",
      "so they can choose what colour the outside is .\n",
      "Textured feel we just talked about .\n",
      "So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that .\n",
      "Yeah that's a very good idea , yeah .\n",
      "still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks .\n",
      "Um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost ,\n",
      "There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't <disfmarker> I don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them .\n",
      "I think we're better doing something basic like this\n",
      "and very <disfmarker> will be a really cool feature to put in .\n",
      "maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves ,\n",
      "<disfmarker> and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate .\n",
      "Yes the the the there are changeable covers ,\n",
      "but on the other hand I I don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it\n",
      "because <vocalsound> you have to introduce a complete uh uh new l line of uh of supplies\n",
      "uh it would be uh very complicated uh organisational <disfmarker>\n",
      "we can afford to have two or three different designs at least .\n",
      "I mean those covers could go for for three , five Euro <vocalsound> .\n",
      "then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures , different forms ,\n",
      "and uh they could be like buttons\n",
      "and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other ,\n",
      "and uh maybe like you can have different colours\n",
      "for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button .\n",
      "So what I have found was that uh currently uh the <gap> they are mostly that the T_V_ , V_C_R_ , music system operated ones actually ,\n",
      "for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have\n",
      "There is also um a speech recognition to store channel information , names ,\n",
      "if you have a multiple functionality , say T_V_ , V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the <gap> T_V_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information <vocalsound> .\n",
      "I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like B_B_C_ , rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad .\n",
      "because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly ,\n",
      "In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for <vocalsound> eighty word thing , eighty word ,\n",
      "which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word .\n",
      "Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control ,\n",
      "you want to st store your favourite channel .\n",
      "Maybe ten channels , yeah at the most .\n",
      "like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing\n",
      "because you have multiple functionalities\n",
      "for example you are watching a movie , and uh uh you are <vocalsound> having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which functionality is <gap> now ,\n",
      "for example I can use a simple toggle switch , and a display ,\n",
      "so I press it so the display says , okay , I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys ,\n",
      "there can be children friendly\n",
      "where you can programme your remote\n",
      "so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them .\n",
      "I personally would look at <vocalsound> things like having a u universal remote ,\n",
      "instead of having <gap> unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition .\n",
      "I got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit\n",
      "that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine ,\n",
      "and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi Joe , or something like that ,\n",
      "But a coffee machine , there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary .\n",
      "so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing , and very isolated word\n",
      "and it's uh it is interesting , and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing\n",
      "and maybe having something like a blinking thing ,\n",
      "like uh it could indicate you're uh <disfmarker> it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote , the blinking .\n",
      "At the same time , if it's a dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also\n",
      "y you want to let the user to programming the keys ? Some of them ?\n",
      "Yeah you can let them to do that .\n",
      "And uh isn't that too difficult\n",
      "I don't know if we still want the um R_C_ to be easy to use ,\n",
      "it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put .\n",
      "You can have it so it's easy <gap> they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it ,\n",
      "or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features .\n",
      "because I I'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents .\n",
      "I'm sorry to have <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Every time I have to come down on this price again\n",
      "so this might be a little limiting for your creativity ,\n",
      "do we think these ideas <vocalsound> an and my uh sp speech recognition , I mean maybe it's possible for for twelve Euro\n",
      "but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh <vocalsound> uh case of the <disfmarker>\n",
      "<vocalsound> I would say that for programming uh keys , you said , uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve Euros ,\n",
      "i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented ,\n",
      "and w how much it's cost , maybe with a f cheap chip .\n",
      "maybe if you added little bit of <gap> display ,\n",
      "you might need the <disfmarker> to che keep checking the battery ,\n",
      "so you really need a some <vocalsound> kind of indicator ,\n",
      "so it could be a blinking option of L_E_D_ <vocalsound>\n",
      "I like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark ,\n",
      "so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them\n",
      "or if they if they light up or something .\n",
      "like if you have an L_C_D_ display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote ,\n",
      "uh which need just uh six six volt uh th sorry three volts um of D_C_ .\n",
      "so y you you may need to check your battery usage\n",
      "and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit .\n",
      "And then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something\n",
      "what I'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a R_C_ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you .\n",
      "there is a a set of components in a in a remote control\n",
      "the the components in themself do not cost a lot\n",
      "there are two uh different types of uh um <disfmarker> Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control .\n",
      "Uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an <gap>\n",
      "that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led\n",
      "that will uh transmit to the receiver .\n",
      "the other components and the circuit board <gap> buttons , infrared <vocalsound> , led , etcetera , for the components\n",
      "just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed ,\n",
      "and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , uh with a different sequence for each key ,\n",
      "electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards\n",
      "uh because it's easier to mass produce and assemble .\n",
      "I think <vocalsound> for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_ uh high technology ,\n",
      "and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to <gap> them and connect them .\n",
      "my personal design <vocalsound>\n",
      "we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use .\n",
      "If it's plastic\n",
      "m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up .\n",
      "So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , for instance , a wooden case .\n",
      "they also emailed me that uh they have <vocalsound> available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a <gap> computer mouse . And uh very cheap L_C_D_s , so liquid crystal displays ,\n",
      "so I'm wondering , I think we might be able to integrate L_C_D_ into our R_C_ .\n",
      "And the final point okay is um we have <disfmarker> yeah there are some uh compromise to to do .\n",
      "we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip ,\n",
      "but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money um which is a higher price range\n",
      "And the display requires an advanced chip ,\n",
      "which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip ,\n",
      "but <vocalsound> I think uh with twelve Euros um and if it's uh uh made for mm four million uh items , then I think w we could be able to handle that .\n",
      "And uh for the designing of the cove uh uh cover layout then it's better to to to maybe see that with uh the the U_R_ exp U_R_I_ Expert\n",
      "so that we can <disfmarker> it's really a team-working\n",
      "for example uh I wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the L_C_D_ display over there ,\n",
      "or if you want to store a programmes with a keys <disfmarker>\n",
      "it's kind of um simple <gap> pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert .\n",
      "I think we could insert one that could underlie several functions\n",
      "How f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things .\n",
      "I think we we should come to some decisions now uh a about this .\n",
      "I understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip ,\n",
      "but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip ,\n",
      "so can we use same chip ,\n",
      "so with one expensive chip we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features .\n",
      "Exactly yeah that's a very good idea ,\n",
      "when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip ,\n",
      "I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know .\n",
      "I think both uh <disfmarker> if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh Euros , it will be okay ,\n",
      "maybe we need specific costings then .\n",
      "do maybe two designs\n",
      "and then cost them out\n",
      "and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better .\n",
      "wh when you make a <vocalsound> a design ca you can <vocalsound> <disfmarker> next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price .\n",
      "like what will be the each individually the cost of it .\n",
      "uh <gap> 'cause it's <disfmarker> I think it's m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber <gap> rather than wood .\n",
      "It will be much ch much expensive\n",
      "I think uh I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition ,\n",
      "but i it's a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood ,\n",
      "and we need maybe to centre our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality we want to offer to the user , and maybe with uh <vocalsound> graphs or I don't know uh <disfmarker> <gap>\n",
      "Let let's say next meeting w <vocalsound> you produce two designs , one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price .\n",
      "We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control .\n",
      "We can give them smooth keys ,\n",
      "The the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small ,\n",
      "for example , as I was <gap> if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people .\n",
      "and not too m too many keys of course yeah .\n",
      "one I've had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom\n",
      "so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time ,\n",
      "So maybe it's possible uh , I don't know whether you can can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are uh buttons you don't use that much .\n",
      "can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box\n",
      "maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be\n",
      "and how many buttons like n we should <vocalsound> dec decide numbers or <disfmarker>\n",
      "I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting .\n",
      "Ju just make two designs ,\n",
      "and the we we can decide decide between th those designs .\n",
      "is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting ?\n",
      "Maybe it would be interesting if you could look um for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition or something like that .\n",
      "uh , I don't know whether that's possible ,\n",
      "maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow .\n",
      "is this <vocalsound> me designing a way to evaluate it\n",
      "<vocalsound> I don't know whether that's possible uh in the given time\n",
      "but a as far as possible .\n",
      "you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes\n",
      "and further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email .\n",
      "One for like cost and the one with like higher-end\n",
      "so that then we can be easily comparing them\n",
      "let's call this to an end .\n",
      "Matthew is uh late again .\n",
      "it is important for him to be here uh .\n",
      "but still I think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer . I think we can put on the <gap> here .\n",
      "we we designed the two uh items .\n",
      "we will just we just have to continue .\n",
      "just for record I I will take uh notes again .\n",
      "first thing uh I was uh uh I got an email from uh from my superior again\n",
      "that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents .\n",
      "when you stay in it's good ,\n",
      "when you don't stay in you have to redesign .\n",
      "maybe Anna , you can have your presentation .\n",
      "we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design .\n",
      "Matthew . Nice uh you are here .\n",
      "ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs .\n",
      "I will start by the the basic one\n",
      "that uh fits into uh eight Euros actually , right , seven eight Euros ,\n",
      "first for both they have um a special shape ,\n",
      "but uh it's like a surf board .\n",
      "And also it's not too far from um a mobile .\n",
      "So people are used to that kind of shape ,\n",
      "Don't take care too much about the colour\n",
      "Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now .\n",
      "the on-off button , in red .\n",
      "Here would be the volume . On the on the left ,\n",
      "so you can go up and down the channels ,\n",
      "uh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back .\n",
      "How can you change from V_C_R_ to uh T_V_ , by the way ?\n",
      "this is a standard T_V_ one ,\n",
      "and then we have usually there twelve keys\n",
      "but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits .\n",
      "The extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel .\n",
      "And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . Actually .\n",
      "It's a very basic minimal thing\n",
      "Exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh .\n",
      "uh i i i it is a very futuristic ,\n",
      "it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future , it can come .\n",
      "Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone .\n",
      "then the this is the <vocalsound> a more a little uh smooth\n",
      "and it gives a lot of functionality , uh in this way ,\n",
      "uh th you see there are only six keys ,\n",
      "they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here .\n",
      "And so they have more space actually\n",
      "and uh it's easy to uh use this\n",
      "and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have ,\n",
      "and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo\n",
      "Play , pause .\n",
      "yeah s pause or stop ,\n",
      "you have a L_C_D_ display , here\n",
      "and uh y this is a functional thing\n",
      "which can change\n",
      "it's a toggle switch\n",
      "which could change the function\n",
      "From D_V_D_ player to television or something .\n",
      "and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_\n",
      "you can have a integrated microphone over here ,\n",
      "This is the orange button , the <vocalsound> microphone .\n",
      "you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display .\n",
      "And here is a small L_E_D_\n",
      "which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery ,\n",
      "and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier\n",
      "then we have a cover\n",
      "<vocalsound> when you need you can use it ,\n",
      "and this gives additional functionality\n",
      "but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed , will it also uh cover up the L_C_D_ screen ?\n",
      "Actually when you are watching the T_V_ , <vocalsound> when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here ,\n",
      "and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually , giving a cover to that actually . Gives a protection\n",
      "It's low weight . You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight .\n",
      "So the the cost is actually a bit more ,\n",
      "So it's well outside the budget then .\n",
      "But the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer .\n",
      "And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be uh something like three Francs per item <disfmarker>\n",
      "Three Euros .\n",
      "That's on top of the sixteen ,\n",
      "or is it part of that ?\n",
      "part of that , yeah .\n",
      "So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition .\n",
      "if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys\n",
      "we should <vocalsound> stick with uh a number of keys\n",
      "it it should not be cluttering up everything .\n",
      "I like the shape of them ,\n",
      "I do like the the size and the the shape .\n",
      "Be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible , maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um <disfmarker>\n",
      "And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two .\n",
      "and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at .\n",
      "it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product .\n",
      "Um we just go through these\n",
      "and rate them as a group\n",
      "and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> These are the things we identified as being important .\n",
      "Um <gap> the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components\n",
      "um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic .\n",
      "And then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well .\n",
      "do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now\n",
      "or do we wanna discuss them further\n",
      "and then evaluate them ?\n",
      "why not why not discuss uh discuss it now , <gap> <disfmarker>\n",
      "just go through onto the whiteboard I guess .\n",
      "the first one was really <vocalsound> very far below budget ,\n",
      "would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that\n",
      "or just have the high profit on it ?\n",
      "my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it .\n",
      "because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros\n",
      "look and feel , innovation <disfmarker> <gap>\n",
      "And now it <gap> easy to use .\n",
      "you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these ?\n",
      "w w we can still discuss that .\n",
      "and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas\n",
      "um I've received uh a framework which we can do this .\n",
      "this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components ,\n",
      "so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh .\n",
      "Th th this is the first design .\n",
      "Um w <vocalsound> one's bad\n",
      "and seven's the best .\n",
      "one's true\n",
      "and seven's false .\n",
      "Look and feel .\n",
      "In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand ,\n",
      "so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel .\n",
      "we should also consider look ,\n",
      "and then i it looks quite conventional .\n",
      "On the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at ,\n",
      "Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five\n",
      "the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say <vocalsound>\n",
      "but uh still I will give four in that case\n",
      "If you press like this not like this\n",
      "C can you get the batteries ?\n",
      "isn't it the ink ?\n",
      "I think it's lost a battery .\n",
      "Because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working ,\n",
      "but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard .\n",
      "And the other one ?\n",
      "I think it's slightly better , um ,\n",
      "actually this is this is not going to protrude actually ,\n",
      "which which 'll be covering in a curve <disfmarker>\n",
      "The other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ?\n",
      "'Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand ,\n",
      "maybe it won't work so well .\n",
      "I'd say two or three for that one , personally .\n",
      "So so <vocalsound> I would also say this is four .\n",
      "because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one .\n",
      "So I will say two .\n",
      "it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one .\n",
      "Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market ,\n",
      "No but except for the design of the surf <vocalsound> .\n",
      "Are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ?\n",
      "I think it's more of the feel .\n",
      "But th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all ,\n",
      "So I'd be up for seven for innovation .\n",
      "And the <disfmarker> And the second one is really uh state of the art , uh in terms of innovation .\n",
      "And um with many more functionalities ,\n",
      "and can open and close the the bottom part .\n",
      "A and the L_C_D_ screen is <disfmarker>\n",
      "That's that's that's well it's quite innovative .\n",
      "And all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this .\n",
      "Uh could put it at one or two I would say . Personally .\n",
      "Th th there were different options we discussed then ,\n",
      "we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget .\n",
      "We just diske discuss it as you designed it\n",
      "and then we will will try to get it in the budget .\n",
      "Sixteen Euros .\n",
      "Innovation for this one is two ? One ?\n",
      "the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> then it's I think one .\n",
      "Ease of use ?\n",
      "the first one is really standard ,\n",
      "so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it ,\n",
      "So that's maybe a a two for ease of use .\n",
      "Um , the other one is quite easy , tho though .\n",
      "Uh , though it has more functionality\n",
      "So maybe a three or a four .\n",
      "maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons .\n",
      "because it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so , <gap> <disfmarker>\n",
      "actually the user has to put some effort to do <disfmarker> use that actually ,\n",
      "So so I think th three is good . Yeah .\n",
      "uh how well it goes to the target demographic .\n",
      "we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ?\n",
      "I would I would give this model to the old people actually .\n",
      "So sh completely changed our demographic there ,\n",
      "exce except for the surfing shape . I mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group I think ,\n",
      "If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being <disfmarker> applying to the the demographic\n",
      "Mm w w w we <disfmarker> after this we can can consider uh for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic\n",
      "'Cause we have got room , we've got some budget there to add a few things to it ,\n",
      "But as it is now , I w would say mm , six , something .\n",
      "because it's so important <disfmarker> it's i it was written that it really so important , the um the the look and uh taking care of its <disfmarker> it targets , the right range of people ,\n",
      "but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually .\n",
      "<vocalsound> we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros .\n",
      "There's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one .\n",
      "So in that case well it's fine then .\n",
      "and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ?\n",
      "It's got the got the the toys in it ,\n",
      "it's got the L_C_D_ screen\n",
      "if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , I think for this audience we need absolutely the L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "I think especially if we're gonna n have an L_C_D_ screen on a low range product then that's good .\n",
      "I'd probably go with three again for that one .\n",
      "Or even <disfmarker> Even one and two . Or two .\n",
      "Yeah two yeah .\n",
      "because you can add <vocalsound> lot of sophistication on that .\n",
      "And especially I guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well ,\n",
      "and that makes it more appealing ,\n",
      "the final point , trends .\n",
      "the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel .\n",
      "as it is , not really doing either of them .\n",
      "Spongy , uh , that means that it goes in in the water . <vocalsound>\n",
      "the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well ,\n",
      "have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons\n",
      "but I'm thinking one of the Nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons\n",
      "that feels kinda spongy .\n",
      "Yeah . We we we we we yeah , it's the way they are going to be , actually .\n",
      "the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie .\n",
      "But that's if you're using the covers .\n",
      "uh uh is it possible do you think , to to make a cover for s such a phone ?\n",
      "they make it for mobiles ,\n",
      "it can't be that much more complicated .\n",
      "just with the with the flexible plastic uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "So you got the option of having different colours or different textures .\n",
      "Yeah I think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , yeah .\n",
      "we can put the the <vocalsound> the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers\n",
      "I think the <disfmarker> if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics ,\n",
      "even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you'll still be able to put a new cover on it\n",
      "look at this computer , th this laptop , it's all black ,\n",
      "and uh it's quite conventional ,\n",
      "and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here .\n",
      "So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things .\n",
      "And then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers .\n",
      "'Cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them .\n",
      "Although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um on the other one .\n",
      "Say , say one and two . One and two .\n",
      "the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so five <disfmarker> mm nine by five , one point s eight ?\n",
      "One point eight yeah .\n",
      "Four point <disfmarker> Uh four point two .\n",
      "Very good .\n",
      "But we still got a very different price for those two\n",
      "so they're not really comparable yet anyway .\n",
      "We <disfmarker> we must try to get them closer .\n",
      "or we just have to choose . And adapt .\n",
      "Because , when we choose for this one we have to <vocalsound> we have to make it more attractive\n",
      "and w when we <gap> to d for this one we have to make it more cheap .\n",
      "it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out .\n",
      "That'll basically take us down to the budget .\n",
      "Uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip , uh Matthew ,\n",
      "so maybe we have to recap with this one .\n",
      "Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this , yeah .\n",
      "let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet ,\n",
      "uh what kind of energy source uh\n",
      "It's a <disfmarker> it's a normal battery , or <disfmarker>\n",
      "maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually .\n",
      "<gap> given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip .\n",
      "Uh sample speaker , yeah .\n",
      "Double curve .\n",
      "Are you talking about this or that ?\n",
      "but they have the same shape ,\n",
      "Uh , plastic would be the material .\n",
      "Uh special colour , now we leave it to the covers .\n",
      "now we're either going button or L_C_D_s , L_C_D_ display .\n",
      "It's okay . Just say L_C_D_ <gap> .\n",
      "So it would need twelve buttons .\n",
      "we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ?\n",
      "but for this one it's twelve Euro .\n",
      "So this comes to eighteen .\n",
      "And that's without any special button supplements .\n",
      "we'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them .\n",
      "it's not it's not double curved ,\n",
      "it's single curved ,\n",
      "it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well , that's what I thought .\n",
      "I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh sure .\n",
      "The bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you sure ?\n",
      "we've got those <disfmarker> the scroll wheel on the side\n",
      "We've got a scroll wheel for the volume\n",
      "this is even more than the um than the cost you gave , the sixteen Euros .\n",
      "That is the sample sensor and sample speaker .\n",
      "We just need that actually . We need one .\n",
      "We <disfmarker> We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip ,\n",
      "but then we can't have the the speech recognition ,\n",
      "this would this would be cutting the speech recognition .\n",
      "but if you have the <disfmarker> near the L_C_D_ you can um <vocalsound> choose <disfmarker> select between um you know like uni universal between audio , T_V_ and V_C_R_ ,\n",
      "and this needs a needs a advanced chip .\n",
      "I think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip .\n",
      "and we still on fifteen ,\n",
      "And what about the number of buttons buttons uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> my Matthew ?\n",
      "when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty .\n",
      "<vocalsound> But that's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material .\n",
      "the L_C_D_ display is is three Francs , sorry three Euros , by itself .\n",
      "We we really want a L_C_D_\n",
      "other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market .\n",
      "So we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget ,\n",
      "So wha what what each of us think about the <disfmarker> because it's measure point the L_C_D_ , um <disfmarker>\n",
      "Or we could even replace them by buttons actually .\n",
      "Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact , you have a big display\n",
      "A actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it ,\n",
      "for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons ,\n",
      "or <disfmarker> and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is <disfmarker> that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least .\n",
      "I think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display .\n",
      "Okay so we can get rid of it\n",
      "and then add a couple of buttons .\n",
      "and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display , there's no way we can get it in there .\n",
      "<vocalsound> S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it ?\n",
      "I th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening . I can't see it fitting in .\n",
      "having an L_C_D_ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons .\n",
      "So hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve .\n",
      "uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons\n",
      "and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here . Here one , at the middle , and at the bottom .\n",
      "I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen . That that's that's my opinion .\n",
      "The speech recognition is out . Because of the budget , yeah .\n",
      "are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ?\n",
      "Which turns out to be on budget exactly , pretty much . With these new costings .\n",
      "and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price ,\n",
      "My m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected .\n",
      "Yeah .\n",
      "w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe\n",
      "and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in\n",
      "but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment .\n",
      "Thank you .\n",
      "That was it . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> Thanks .\n",
      "Okay so welcome everyone .\n",
      "So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control .\n",
      "So I will first start with a warm welcome opening <vocalsound> stuff ,\n",
      "then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it .\n",
      "And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas\n",
      "and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be <disfmarker> you will have to fulfil to complete this process .\n",
      "So the the goal is to have a remote control\n",
      "so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly .\n",
      "So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points .\n",
      "First it will be the functional design .\n",
      "Third is the conceptual design\n",
      "and then is the desired design .\n",
      "So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil .\n",
      "And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that .\n",
      "And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing <vocalsound> and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point .\n",
      "So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board .\n",
      "It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan .\n",
      "Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost . <vocalsound>\n",
      "It's a cat .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow . <vocalsound>\n",
      "So <disfmarker> Here the uh financial objective of our project .\n",
      "That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros\n",
      "and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Yeah if it's trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs .\n",
      "so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple .\n",
      "Maybe I can have the <disfmarker> your opinion from the marketing side ?\n",
      "Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one\n",
      "Okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device .\n",
      "And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil ?\n",
      "If we don't have so many buttons could be nice .\n",
      "And do you have it also to be <disfmarker> to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ?\n",
      "Something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box .\n",
      "So . Fit in your hand , yeah .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Water-proof as well .\n",
      "Maybe water-proof would be very original .\n",
      "And , and that's one of the <disfmarker> that's one of the shock <disfmarker> I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it .\n",
      "But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well .\n",
      "Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well .\n",
      "most of the time I I lose my remote control .\n",
      "We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping .\n",
      "Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep .\n",
      "That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve .\n",
      "So i it's just going to add t to the cost .\n",
      "Yeah . We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Okay so try to find that for next meeting . <vocalsound>\n",
      "So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working <disfmarker> any working function we have discussed .\n",
      "So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user .\n",
      "And also um <vocalsound> I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user .\n",
      "and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I think that's all for this point .\n",
      "So we are here for the functional design meeting mm\n",
      "I will take notes during this meeting so\n",
      "I will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards\n",
      "so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time\n",
      "We have a technical problem uh .\n",
      "Otherwise , could you just describe\n",
      "by hand ?\n",
      "With the the whiteboard ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> So um the question well first of all what to control .\n",
      "So <vocalsound> most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and T_V_ and stuff like that .\n",
      "and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house .\n",
      "so there's a project I think called X_ house or something like that that does that , uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff .\n",
      "the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever .\n",
      "Uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have\n",
      "uh at the same time as <disfmarker> and general voice commands if you want yeah .\n",
      "so the user interface will consist of two parts .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space ,\n",
      "a set of buttons for <vocalsound> linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access .\n",
      "What do you mean by linear access then ?\n",
      "Like a video tape goes forward , backwards , uh fast and stuff yeah .\n",
      "For special navigation for example you might have a T_V_ in the menu and you going to change yeah ?\n",
      "and also parameter changing .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um\n",
      "or maybe we could have everything uh generic\n",
      "Voice command w we could specify anything .\n",
      "We could assign any button <disfmarker> a command to any button , if we have enough processing power ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um I dunno if you can open the <disfmarker>\n",
      "<vocalsound> Short-cut to AMI shared folder ?\n",
      "Maybe you can send it to me by email .\n",
      "I will try to show it to everyone ,\n",
      "in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects\n",
      "and the subjects also filled a questionnaire\n",
      "so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly\n",
      "Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy .\n",
      "seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Uh the buttons have <disfmarker> are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh <vocalsound> ten per cents of but of the buttons in the <disfmarker> in the remote control .\n",
      "F not many buttons , and uh and uh uh u useable buttons <vocalsound> .\n",
      "but in fact we <disfmarker> it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management\n",
      "so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to <vocalsound> to\n",
      "lot of the time they <disfmarker> it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control .\n",
      "So they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use .\n",
      "And uh remote controls are bad for\n",
      "R_S_I_\n",
      "so you <disfmarker> we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah .\n",
      "We know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um and um to to change uh volume selection of the <disfmarker>\n",
      "<vocalsound> for the younger it's very important\n",
      "To have L_C_D_ and voice .\n",
      "and speech recognition .\n",
      "And uh and the others is not so important\n",
      "So as we say before , I think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing .\n",
      "Because I received that email from management board\n",
      "and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important .\n",
      "but I think we have some technical problem or so .\n",
      "So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control .\n",
      "Basically we have a a battery a power supply here .\n",
      "After that we just have um user interface .\n",
      "which could be um a L_C_D_ let's say or um an array of push button , something like that .\n",
      "Push button or a L_C_D_ .\n",
      "After that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip .\n",
      "So I say U_C_ and I feed that to uh L_E_D_ which is uh infrared <disfmarker> um which is a an infrared um component .\n",
      "Um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh\n",
      "standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that .\n",
      "So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition .\n",
      "I would say uh about eight months to have the first results .\n",
      "How much will it cost for one hundred thousand ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> Usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip .\n",
      "and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ?\n",
      "another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else .\n",
      "so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage\n",
      "so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that <disfmarker>\n",
      "So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users ,\n",
      "And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the <disfmarker> on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product .\n",
      "So before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the <disfmarker> o th of the control <disfmarker> of the remote control\n",
      "so from from the the Marketing Expert I think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect ,\n",
      "So few buttons , channel , volume control\n",
      "Maybe switch T_V_ on and off <vocalsound>\n",
      "I discovered that when I did a quick look , uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now ,\n",
      "you have a button , you you press it , and this is uh the previous channel which has come back .\n",
      "Maybe we can include that also . Previous previous channel button .\n",
      "How should they how should we implement that ?\n",
      "Because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental .\n",
      "This is uh incremental , but once you press it for a long time , you go five by five .\n",
      "Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one .\n",
      "I mean you know there is are some <gap> with a wheel like this .\n",
      "Instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel .\n",
      "So have a wheel for incremental , have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed\n",
      "not a a wheel but a ball ,\n",
      "I would say the wheel is better .\n",
      "so it should be lightening in the dark I think because most people lost their remote control .\n",
      "and do we put an L_C_D_ display ?\n",
      "If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having L_C_D_ .\n",
      "Just increase the cost .\n",
      "So no L_C_D_ ?\n",
      "And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process\n",
      "Yeah . That would be cool .\n",
      "But eight months is really long\n",
      "so I we will move to next meeting so in <disfmarker> after the lunch break\n",
      "and I I will make a summary of that meeting that I will put in the shared folder you can't see <vocalsound>\n",
      "Uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether .\n",
      "So we are here for the concept design meeting .\n",
      "So , we will first start by summarizing the mm <vocalsound> the previous meeting and the decision we've taken .\n",
      "So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours .\n",
      "We'll then t take decision in concert\n",
      "and then uh uh we will uh define the nest <disfmarker> next task , to have <disfmarker> to be done before the next meeting .\n",
      "So maybe we can start with uh industrial design .\n",
      "you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button\n",
      "and in our case we are using a um a wheel control .\n",
      "The push button are usually extremely cheap ,\n",
      "but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive .\n",
      "And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not <disfmarker> if if we could combine something with the push button .\n",
      "Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button .\n",
      "So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ?\n",
      "We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money .\n",
      "You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed .\n",
      "Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff ,\n",
      "the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button ,\n",
      "We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button .\n",
      "Um , what is the purpose of the light ?\n",
      "You can easily find the button in the dark or so ?\n",
      "As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light .\n",
      "I don't think that this is really expensive ,\n",
      "Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so ,\n",
      "But it can be uh battery consuming , no ?\n",
      "To have the light always on ?\n",
      "Yeah , a little bit .\n",
      "So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls .\n",
      "And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple .\n",
      "And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler .\n",
      "We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle .\n",
      "So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power ,\n",
      "So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two .\n",
      "With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part .\n",
      "I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb .\n",
      "Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way .\n",
      "Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel\n",
      "and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case .\n",
      "Maybe the wheel will be a <vocalsound> good advantage over our competitors .\n",
      "And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends ,\n",
      "uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So , maybe if our <vocalsound> remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> And the mm the material is expected to be spongy .\n",
      "I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing ,\n",
      "Yeah , because it's robust .\n",
      "I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has .\n",
      "that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible .\n",
      "Maybe uh um <vocalsound> a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that .\n",
      "Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess .\n",
      "Yeah . Maybe pear yeah or something like that .\n",
      "And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice ,\n",
      "But that's not in the trend . <vocalsound> .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well .\n",
      "I think we can keep the wheel\n",
      "Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then .\n",
      "but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control ,\n",
      "You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company .\n",
      "So we will just use a a standard battery ?\n",
      "chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use .\n",
      "I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape .\n",
      "I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it .\n",
      "So we are here for the detailed design meeting .\n",
      "I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting .\n",
      "I will also take notes during this meeting\n",
      "and I will send you uh a summary then as usual .\n",
      "We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues\n",
      "<vocalsound> And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product .\n",
      "Then we will uh evaluate the product .\n",
      "And uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with <disfmarker> it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not .\n",
      "let's start with the cost aspect\n",
      "I look at the aspect discussed last time ,\n",
      "that is to say uh to have a standard battery ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it\n",
      "uh to feel spongy ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera .\n",
      "And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros .\n",
      "which is uh good ,\n",
      "because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros .\n",
      "for the financial aspect it's okay ,\n",
      "we can uh <disfmarker> we can continue with this product uh as if ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert .\n",
      "I made an evaluation\n",
      "and the the evaluation criteria is made according to <vocalsound> the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings .\n",
      "we have uh six points .\n",
      "we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , <vocalsound> easy to find in a room , and robust ,\n",
      "I have a scale of uh seven points .\n",
      "I go through all the uh all the points here ,\n",
      "and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point , two point or seven point .\n",
      "And after we ha we have an an average , and uh we see .\n",
      "fancy look and feel , what do you think ?\n",
      "between o one and seven .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So I think it's uh very uh very nice .\n",
      "I give it a <disfmarker> I give it a five .\n",
      "it's between one and seven ?\n",
      "Seven is the highest uh ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> Seven is the <disfmarker>\n",
      "I will give a six .\n",
      "I will give a a five .\n",
      "Maybe we all have to agree on a common <disfmarker>\n",
      "uh I don't know if you <disfmarker> we ha we have to put uh one uh f If it's better or <disfmarker>\n",
      "we can choose what we want .\n",
      "let's say that seven is the best .\n",
      "do note the grade we have five , six for me ,\n",
      "How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ?\n",
      "I think six , it's a good uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "So it will have five point five average .\n",
      "after , the technological aspect ?\n",
      "we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel .\n",
      "We also have the rubber material ,\n",
      "I think I would give a five .\n",
      "It's <gap> four .\n",
      "A four also ,\n",
      "because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation .\n",
      "are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ?\n",
      "No .\n",
      "Yeah , four . Four , yeah , let's put four .\n",
      "Very easy to use . Do you think it's easy to use ?\n",
      "I give a seven , I think .\n",
      "Mm , six for me also .\n",
      "six point five .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Is it fashion ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "its its f its fruit fruit shape .\n",
      "Yeah it's fashion ,\n",
      "we can we can put a seven here .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Easy to find .\n",
      "I think you can't miss it .\n",
      "I think it's cool .\n",
      "We have the lightning ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> So you'll make the material transparent\n",
      "so that it uh lights up completely ,\n",
      "I would say seven .\n",
      "Is it <disfmarker> is it robust ?\n",
      "it's rubber , made of rubber ,\n",
      "the only problem there might be <disfmarker> which <gap> know , i if it's very sensitive ,\n",
      "But it is uh <disfmarker> it is surrounded by rubber material .\n",
      "So maybe we can put a six .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Everybody is okay , six .\n",
      "We have to sum up everything .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Six is a good <disfmarker>\n",
      "Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better ,\n",
      "and when uh s six sit six are good <disfmarker> it's a good uh p product , I think .\n",
      "So it's a good evaluation , I think .\n",
      "We have a good price\n",
      "So this prototype is quite nice . <vocalsound>\n",
      "So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive , I think .\n",
      "we have seen the prototype .\n",
      "It's very nice according to the work of our two designer .\n",
      "The the the financial aspect were okay .\n",
      "We we have the cost below uh our threshold\n",
      "and so we could sell at twenty five Euros\n",
      "and make i make profit .\n",
      "The the evaluation give satisfying result as well .\n",
      "the cost is in the budget ,\n",
      "the evaluation is okay ,\n",
      "so I th I think we can now uh open champagne\n",
      "<vocalsound> Congratulations to the team .\n",
      "Uh very well , we worked together fantastically .\n",
      "I think it was a good collaboration uh .\n",
      "we are here to talk about functional design .\n",
      "Now hopefully we've all got a better idea from <vocalsound> <disfmarker> than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now .\n",
      "So here's an agenda .\n",
      "Um you should know that I'll be taking minutes during all the meetings ,\n",
      "and that'll be easier for me now because I'm not actually giving the whole presentation .\n",
      "Uh the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that I forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> now <vocalsound> you can all give your presentations .\n",
      "We can talk about the requirements\n",
      "and hopefully come to some decisions .\n",
      "Uh did you all receive that email ?\n",
      "So does anyone have any overall <gap>\n",
      "Well <vocalsound> uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having <vocalsound> no teletext , people are very comfortable <vocalsound> with <vocalsound> the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not <disfmarker> we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now .\n",
      "What are we gonna have that makes this thing better than <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity\n",
      "because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the Internet <disfmarker> <vocalsound> there is the opportunity that's presented , I guess .\n",
      "Right . Yeah . No , I I agree with you .\n",
      "So what I'm talking about is I see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side\n",
      "which is , what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that <vocalsound> identifies our product as better than <disfmarker> because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta .\n",
      "but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television .\n",
      "So we're quite fixed .\n",
      "So we're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that's uh that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product .\n",
      "So uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_ that we <disfmarker> people use our remote with .\n",
      "So it's kind of a stupid decision .\n",
      "we really have to innovate here I guess .\n",
      "'cause somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy\n",
      "'cause it took <disfmarker> they can't ac access their teletext .\n",
      "'Cause we're talking about <vocalsound> eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext .\n",
      "It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ?\n",
      "I think that the <vocalsound> last point is probably quite uh straightforward .\n",
      "Obviously the the <disfmarker> w it has to be branded .\n",
      "So then the double R_ will be our our <disfmarker>\n",
      "Can you handle that black and yellow ?\n",
      "I think w , yeah , one of the things that we should also keep in mind um when we're doing this <disfmarker> I mean our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , right .\n",
      "So I think our kind of <disfmarker> our target here is to <vocalsound> have some kind of very like sleek <vocalsound> nice look remote\n",
      "but I think one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here .\n",
      "We want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so <disfmarker>\n",
      "So we have three presentations ,\n",
      "and I think we'll go in order of participant number here .\n",
      "So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two .\n",
      "I'm the Industrial Designer .\n",
      "And we've some basic components that um our remote is gonna need ,\n",
      "just basically every remote'll need 'em .\n",
      "We need some kinda of power d power source .\n",
      "Um we have to decide on our our user interface , which is his department ,\n",
      "but the in user interface is also a major component .\n",
      "Um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red L_E_D_ , which you aim at the television uh which <disfmarker> and it receives that signal .\n",
      "You need a on-off switch\n",
      "And uh we also need to um have the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of T_V_s .\n",
      "So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals\n",
      "and so that'll require some memory as well .\n",
      "Um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work .\n",
      "You ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there ,\n",
      "and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing ,\n",
      "and then passes that signal on to the infra-red L_E_D_\n",
      "and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor .\n",
      "We're talking about existing technology .\n",
      "this is just <disfmarker> this is just a basic layout of ev <vocalsound> of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote .\n",
      "We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition ,\n",
      "I mean that <vocalsound> I mean <vocalsound> that you can kinda say would <vocalsound> would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip .\n",
      "Do we have an idea of costs of different components ?\n",
      "Um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip\n",
      "basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well .\n",
      "Um the L_E_D_ and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap .\n",
      "So depending on what we want our functionality to be , um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap .\n",
      "Um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h <vocalsound> you know how much power .\n",
      "We uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that .\n",
      "Um but <disfmarker> and I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things like that , I think .\n",
      "That's all I have really .\n",
      "So yeah function design .\n",
      "what I found is we want to do fashion\n",
      "and I think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically\n",
      "and try to aim for design .\n",
      "basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad\n",
      "so we ma we have to make it look good .\n",
      "Um something cute and small .\n",
      "The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties .\n",
      "And um although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for uh <disfmarker> that have loads of loads of little functions and everything\n",
      "and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things\n",
      "and most the people won't won't get too mad of actually having to go the <disfmarker> to the s to the television to , for instance , tune in their <disfmarker> the stations .\n",
      "There's no need to have that in the remote .\n",
      "um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo , but <vocalsound> um we should go for the user-oriented device ,\n",
      "so simple controls and good ergonomics .\n",
      "Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that , I guess ,\n",
      "But I t I think what the <vocalsound> the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it .\n",
      "So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there .\n",
      "I mean <vocalsound> even if it's necessary or not , if you <disfmarker> if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really <disfmarker>\n",
      "if it i <vocalsound> if it isn't more expensive for us to k make <disfmarker> because as far as I understand it , <vocalsound> it can be operated with the same set of buttons , yeah ?\n",
      "i it's just uh <vocalsound> the cost of an extra button .\n",
      "I <disfmarker> in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the <disfmarker> it's gonna be out-moded teletext .\n",
      "I I don't understand how those two things are connected .\n",
      "How does how does computers and teletext <disfmarker> h how <disfmarker> why is one eliminating the need of the other ?\n",
      "Well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh Internet through the T_V_ for example .\n",
      "the they're basically aiming at saying that <vocalsound> you would use <disfmarker> you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that\n",
      "But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities .\n",
      "I just <disfmarker> I don't see the cross-over between computers and television .\n",
      "I mean I do see the cross-over in some sense ,\n",
      "but but but but with the <disfmarker> the remote is is used for television , okay .\n",
      "Well there there is a <disfmarker> for example on digital T_V_ systems you have <disfmarker> you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts ,\n",
      "Yeah , and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live T_V_ and things like that .\n",
      "They're just features from the Internet uh from computers are are coming into the T_V_ sort of under the covers ,\n",
      "And all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and <disfmarker>\n",
      "If if it's <vocalsound> , for example , a trainable one then we're <vocalsound> just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it .\n",
      "but I guess we can remove it\n",
      "I think if it's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that .\n",
      "I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext ,\n",
      "Yeah , and neither do I in fact .\n",
      "a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it doesn't affect the price .\n",
      "but we're not putting some <disfmarker> there's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext .\n",
      "and and we're also <vocalsound> marketing a product . It's <disfmarker> what I'm seeing is a is a mid-range cost product .\n",
      "So so w we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing\n",
      "So if we're keeping it basic we're loo loo what we're looking to sell it basically is it's uh just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that sort of thing .\n",
      "and to me if I'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for for design I'm gonna I'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price .\n",
      "I want I want to market it as exclusive .\n",
      "So I would market this product it <disfmarker> at eighty-nine Euros\n",
      "and come up with some really <vocalsound> beautiful exterior design or something\n",
      "th but but I don't think we have that flexibility .\n",
      "But i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty-five Euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden <disfmarker> stan standard T_V_\n",
      "and if I'm coming in with a with with twenty-five Euros , which is mid-market price , um then what am I going to give these people for this ?\n",
      "just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands .\n",
      "Um as for , you know , the the case design uh maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas .\n",
      "Right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small um <disfmarker>\n",
      "I'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people <vocalsound> how many people actually use every feature\n",
      "you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , you know , it's just so confusing to do <vocalsound> to use all these functions .\n",
      "Where I think the largest portion of the market is just gonna <disfmarker> you know they lost their T_V_ remote , they need another one that'll work with their T_V_ .\n",
      "They want something that looks nice ,\n",
      "that you know that maybe it's it's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that .\n",
      "I think that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest , you know , market share .\n",
      "I think the more bells and whistles we add , it's just gonna cut into our into our profits .\n",
      "Because I think as we as we add costs for things like uh <disfmarker> for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , I think <vocalsound> you know what percentage of the of the um of the market is actually gonna use that ?\n",
      "But we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this .\n",
      "Oh P Pedro , I just want to say quickly I I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , eh .\n",
      "You know sell uh <disfmarker> things come to my mind is uh uh something that's uh <vocalsound> um voice-activated .\n",
      "'Cause uh and I think of voice-activated\n",
      "I think of of <vocalsound> how many times I've I've lost my my remote and I can't find it .\n",
      "So some way that I can I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something\n",
      "our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their V_C_R_s , their D_V_D_s , their <vocalsound> their televisions\n",
      "And so to me we have to make this a really special product\n",
      "but I I don't see the market niche for this product without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market .\n",
      "But we th that should be design .\n",
      "I think technology we'd we <disfmarker> we're not in the price range to do it .\n",
      "so we should we should aim at design .\n",
      "Okay well , so so that's up to you then\n",
      "Does any of the um the features that Pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ?\n",
      "I think all these things are pretty standard .\n",
      "Onto participant <vocalsound> four .\n",
      "'til you spoke and when I wrote this , I don't know what I'm marketing .\n",
      "I just know that I I was identified as a a <disfmarker> we identified ourselves as a as a developer , as a manufacturer , and as a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers .\n",
      "And so the th the twenty-five Euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price .\n",
      "Um so what I did is I I decided that <vocalsound> that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself .\n",
      "We're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> so I would like to have a product that that we can sell easily .\n",
      "so having something beauty , something attractive , uh something that in a sense will sell itself .\n",
      "Uh innovation I think fits into what we're talking about here with design .\n",
      "Uh cutting edge technology , I don't think we're gonna have that ,\n",
      "um unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned .\n",
      "I I talked about environmentally sensitive ,\n",
      "uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home .\n",
      "Uh I wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation ,\n",
      "that we're new , we're aggressive , we're competitive , we're we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line .\n",
      "So to me it's about selling d uh our identity <disfmarker> our corporate identity along with the product .\n",
      "Uh we're kind of in the middle of the market ,\n",
      "but again , because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations , I don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing .\n",
      "And it's kind of <vocalsound> along the s lines of environmentally sensitive ,\n",
      "and it may even fit into ergonomics ,\n",
      "and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote , what we were saying it's a common issue .\n",
      "Um what we can do is , well you know that batteries <disfmarker> throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy . Right ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> Well maybe not a solar remote\n",
      "but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ?\n",
      "Like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it ,\n",
      "'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote ,\n",
      "and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote .\n",
      "I I think it's a good opportunity for the user design <disfmarker>\n",
      "You know you could have some kind of neat little , you know , <vocalsound> a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself .\n",
      "but we're talking about <disfmarker> in cost is gonna probably double .\n",
      "And you could page the remote if you lose it .\n",
      "Now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per ?\n",
      "No no . No no ,\n",
      "we have t we have to change the end cost .\n",
      "We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh <vocalsound> Can we dl can we do that without <vocalsound> uh changing it twelve-fifty per product , if we basically can sell more based on this ?\n",
      "I <vocalsound> <disfmarker> my reaction is no , but\n",
      "<vocalsound> what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs\n",
      "we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well , see I I <disfmarker> see I I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product .\n",
      "Let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , uh high-tech design , uh ergonomics , all of this .\n",
      "I just don't know about that , because in order to do that <vocalsound> <disfmarker> in order to price it at that kind of level I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering\n",
      "like being able to operate , you know , the D_V_D_ player and , you know , the stereo system and all that .\n",
      "Which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of .\n",
      "I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext .\n",
      "But I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have .\n",
      "They gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want ,\n",
      "and and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate .\n",
      "I don't know what kind of role we have in this <disfmarker> in the corporate ladder uh ,\n",
      "do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss ?\n",
      "beca I I do not <disfmarker> I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now .\n",
      "I think our market niche is basically people who need <vocalsound> <disfmarker> who have lost their remote\n",
      "and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote .\n",
      "I th I think it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple T_V_s , yeah ,\n",
      "'cause it's selling on its own .\n",
      "All you need to do is train them to the individual one ,\n",
      "they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions .\n",
      "If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s , V_C_R_s and everything , then I can see the market niche ,\n",
      "because who wants just a television remote ?\n",
      "If you're in the market for this ultimate remote , you're not gonna go for just a television remote .\n",
      "So we really can't chase that .\n",
      "We're really looking for something basic .\n",
      "The the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're we're carrying the corporate identity with the product ,\n",
      "where I'd be inclined to go back to upper-level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here .\n",
      "We're trying to get mind-share about uh Real Reaction to to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics .\n",
      "And and we're gonna make it <disfmarker> we're gonna win mind-share by uh either being a fantastic product\n",
      "or for it working , it just being good , reasonable-priced , <vocalsound> and solid .\n",
      "W <vocalsound> okay if you if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make <disfmarker> go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of a sudden now we're going into an a a new market area .\n",
      "But what I'm saying is right now we're middle market .\n",
      "Is twenty-five Euros a mid-market price for a remote ?\n",
      "We have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous ,\n",
      "It's gotta be low-cost or high-cost with with special design features .\n",
      "Well I'd be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it .\n",
      "If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty-five and make a low profit-margin on it ,\n",
      "And I can communicate this to to the more senior <vocalsound> uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction .\n",
      "I like the idea ,\n",
      "I w I don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down .\n",
      "It <disfmarker> i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair ,\n",
      "and that implies that there's only one T_V_ user .\n",
      "it would last for several hours on its own power ,\n",
      "but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle .\n",
      "But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent .\n",
      "I d I d I d I think it it <disfmarker> in my mind it doesn't seem like something that oh I'd really want uh because of that fact .\n",
      "Well , I think again it's it <disfmarker> we have a cost issue here .\n",
      "Uh we should keep it simple , mm medium-low cost mar um cost area and uh make it look good .\n",
      "The box is gonna sell it I think , the outside , the casing .\n",
      "Can can can we have multiple designs ?\n",
      "and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from .\n",
      "I don't know what that creates cost , or <disfmarker>\n",
      "<vocalsound> Yeah we we need to , I mean , have a few designs to look at\n",
      "I think w what's really important is it has to look good ,\n",
      "it has to be durable ,\n",
      "it has to a and I think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap .\n",
      "what about a a remote that's <vocalsound> that <vocalsound> doesn't maybe look like a remote ?\n",
      "it it opens like a telephone .\n",
      "Or what if it looks like a pen ?\n",
      "I don't have a problem selling a product ,\n",
      "Once you have the finished product I'll find a way to sell it .\n",
      "un unless you guys are die-hard against the fact that um it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you can't lose it on your own , I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle .\n",
      "Because I really think i in a certain sense it almost like <disfmarker> for me I would want to have that just , because I know at the end of when I'm done watching T_V_ that when I'm done , oh I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs .\n",
      "One thing I just thought about when you were saying that , is that the p our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken <disfmarker>\n",
      "Can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one ?\n",
      "And so with with with this kind of system or locator or something , to to think about , how have people been been losing or breaking their remote ?\n",
      "And and then and then design the product , maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy .\n",
      "Whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all\n",
      "The locator'll definitely be more expensive .\n",
      "Um need to look into whether we can do that\n",
      "I think one of the things that we can put right on the box is , never buy another battery .\n",
      "'Kay so we've got our conceptual design meeting .\n",
      "'Kay so here's our agenda our agenda . Um\n",
      "I'm gonna open .\n",
      "I'm gonna take some notes .\n",
      "We're gonna all do a presentation ,\n",
      "and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now .\n",
      "I'm gonna let you guys talk before we make decisions .\n",
      "Components design .\n",
      "So so here's a look inside your really old-looking remote control .\n",
      "Um you've got <vocalsound> a printed <vocalsound> a printed uh circuit board here ,\n",
      "and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber <vocalsound> nubbies into these little holes that activate <disfmarker>\n",
      "So you've also got um <disfmarker> you've got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "so you've got <disfmarker> here's here's a transistor , and this amplifies your signal ,\n",
      "um you've got the L_E_D_ here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board .\n",
      "Um you've got a couple diodes here for I don't know who and whatnot <vocalsound> .\n",
      "So um we've got a <disfmarker> i in this in this uh drawing he uh in this example here , this is a eighteen pin um uh chip <vocalsound> I dunno .\n",
      "Uh it's two double A_ batteries .\n",
      "This is pretty standard remote .\n",
      "So here are options for our power sources .\n",
      "You can use a basic battery , which we've already discussed ,\n",
      "um <vocalsound> th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that .\n",
      "So that's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy ,\n",
      "so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it <vocalsound> .\n",
      "Uh we've got solar cells ,\n",
      "which I don't think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night <vocalsound>\n",
      "And finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea .\n",
      "Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here ?\n",
      "I like the kinetic .\n",
      "Well it is it is more uh <disfmarker> I mean it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle\n",
      "We have uh choices in materials\n",
      "and choices in the general shapes that we can do .\n",
      "Our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic , a rubber latex type thing , uh wood , or titanium .\n",
      "If we go with titanium we're gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do\n",
      "Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , wouldn't it .\n",
      "I I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote ,\n",
      "whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it .\n",
      "Um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell ,\n",
      "to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell\n",
      "and a t um kind of a <disfmarker> to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable ,\n",
      "The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is <disfmarker> w we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape\n",
      "But basically these are <vocalsound> curved and double-curved\n",
      "I I believe that the tech department , in their um <vocalsound> in their <vocalsound> message to me , that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom .\n",
      "I have no idea exactly what they're talking about ,\n",
      "but that's what they told me , <vocalsound> uncurved , flat , curved , or double-curved .\n",
      "I think curved means just curved in one axis\n",
      "and double-curved is curved in two axes\n",
      "Um okay , with the interface we have the following options ,\n",
      "we can u we can use push buttons ,\n",
      "we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button ,\n",
      "and L_C_D_ display ,\n",
      "or multiple scrolling wheels .\n",
      "Um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh <disfmarker> has at his disposal to put together a user interface .\n",
      "For electronics , we have these very technical um <vocalsound> descriptions here .\n",
      "A simple chip , which is the least expensive ,\n",
      "but I have no numbers to give you ,\n",
      "a regular chip , which is <vocalsound> like the medium porridge <disfmarker> the <vocalsound> medium expense uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip ?\n",
      "A simple chip is required to operate push buttons .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> an advanced chip is required to to operate um the L_C_D_ display ,\n",
      "and it didn't say specifically , but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels .\n",
      "That's the end of my presentation .\n",
      "Oh interface concept .\n",
      "our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition .\n",
      "They say they could put it to work\n",
      "but um we don't think so .\n",
      "It it it <disfmarker> you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and <disfmarker>\n",
      "I mean it'll <disfmarker> if somebody says up in the middle of a television show , it's gonna change the channel .\n",
      "But what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ?\n",
      "Well then why don't you just press the up button ?\n",
      "Even still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the T_V_ .\n",
      "I think it's a bad idea frankly .\n",
      "Yeah so um taking that away , our uh <disfmarker> the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable <disfmarker>\n",
      "it's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage\n",
      "and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it\n",
      "Well , we wanna small r remote control one side\n",
      "because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed ,\n",
      "but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost ,\n",
      "But um yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that . Somehow .\n",
      "Um so <vocalsound> the the <disfmarker> what I would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh\n",
      "but without <disfmarker> with a l a less complicated um design ,\n",
      "so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access .\n",
      "Uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial .\n",
      "And um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext .\n",
      "So we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ?\n",
      "i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross ,\n",
      "um yeah so I think we w we go for something mid-sized ,\n",
      "so something looks good\n",
      "and uh is not too prone to get lost .\n",
      "Trend watching I guess .\n",
      "When I s when I see the <disfmarker> when I see the product I I I I don't wanna buy it .\n",
      "There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there .\n",
      "Are you talking about the picture ?\n",
      "That's not our that's not our b design ,\n",
      "Okay 'cause 'cause right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product\n",
      "because we don't have a product to market yet .\n",
      "And uh from from talking to Mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now .\n",
      "Uh without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand .\n",
      "Uh I like the idea of of the scroll\n",
      "what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different .\n",
      "I give me a lower price ,\n",
      "give me a higher price ,\n",
      "give me some new technology ,\n",
      "I'd I'd say though that we <disfmarker> if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well ,\n",
      "when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the <disfmarker> having the cradle\n",
      "and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior ,\n",
      "Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here .\n",
      "so what I'm saying is , from my perspective , I don't have a product to market right now .\n",
      "Um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower\n",
      "or develop an integrated new technol technology .\n",
      "Yeah uh again I'm not sold on the product\n",
      "because we don't have a product in my opinion yet .\n",
      "If you if you give me <disfmarker> if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost .\n",
      "So our big <vocalsound> questions here really are cradle or not cradle ?\n",
      "Do we go basic or do we go for features ?\n",
      "Uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ?\n",
      "Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> Yeah . Well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do .\n",
      "now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons .\n",
      "So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique .\n",
      "What I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make .\n",
      "<disfmarker> if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it ,\n",
      "but I mean I would just use <disfmarker> if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down .\n",
      "No we can <disfmarker> we can do multiple scroll wheels but <disfmarker>\n",
      "my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the <vocalsound> uh dock to put it in <disfmarker> to to charge it .\n",
      "We can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things .\n",
      "It's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle .\n",
      "What type of casing ?\n",
      "I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber .\n",
      "I'm thinking <disfmarker> yeah something like kinda almost like these pens , you know ,\n",
      "where there's <disfmarker> you have plastic bits\n",
      "and then it's not really rubber\n",
      "but just kinda like a fused <disfmarker> the plastic with rubber on the outside .\n",
      "Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip , sorta thing or for <disfmarker>\n",
      "d d do we want to do anything more basic with the <disfmarker> uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for <vocalsound> um buttons ,\n",
      "or do we want <disfmarker> if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go L_C_D_ ?\n",
      "Or from from my perspective I think L_C_D_ is a mistake\n",
      "and all you're doing <disfmarker> I mean it's <disfmarker> you're not gonna get any information back from the television ,\n",
      "so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you <vocalsound> just sent it at last\n",
      "so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the <disfmarker> a cable box or something there's no s I don't see the ,\n",
      "So , what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ?\n",
      "Well we have to <disfmarker> I think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be .\n",
      "You know the other thing I thought about was you know , do we go to something like this ?\n",
      "Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote .\n",
      "Well I dunno about like the flip-phone idea ,\n",
      "I mean what I see <disfmarker> one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children , <vocalsound> their their stuff gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and stuff .\n",
      "And what I keep throwing out there <disfmarker> I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different .\n",
      "and I guess th th the question th <vocalsound> th that you're being asked right now is whether <disfmarker> is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product ,\n",
      "or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ?\n",
      "Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost .\n",
      "I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , I think those are two very strong features ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> The locator's gonna require a radio transmitter ,\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip , s I would imagine .\n",
      "I know personally that would be a very attractive feature , is to have a uh have a button I can push to find my remote control .\n",
      "And it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep .\n",
      "But I guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap ,\n",
      "So the scroll wheel , in or out ?\n",
      "Mm pr my personal preference is out .\n",
      "For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad .\n",
      "I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> I I think there's <disfmarker> you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing <disfmarker> are television surfers ,\n",
      "and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing .\n",
      "Now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of T_V_s won't re the T_V_s won't respond exactly the same .\n",
      "so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip .\n",
      "You could basically make it so that it'll <disfmarker> I mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the T_V_ yeah the T_V_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once .\n",
      "it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want ,\n",
      "Now the the only thing I I <vocalsound> <disfmarker> on the interface side of it , is that <vocalsound> I I I see the dilemma .\n",
      "So I can go uh <vocalsound> presuming I have , on my television , something that tells me what channel I'm on , I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two .\n",
      "'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button . Okay ?\n",
      "So ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ?\n",
      "so if <disfmarker> maybe if we had an L_C_D_ up the top that just did a number on it , right ?\n",
      "It'll tell you when you flip the channel on the T_V_ .\n",
      "How would you program it though ?\n",
      "Well you just <disfmarker> it's one extra button .\n",
      "You say programme start , and then type in <disfmarker>\n",
      "And again we have another another great marketing tool .\n",
      "The problem we're gonna have is making it robust .\n",
      "Oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two .\n",
      "well then you just have , you have a diff you have a mode switch .\n",
      "So right details th <vocalsound> that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel .\n",
      "We want <vocalsound> a mode indicator .\n",
      "We want <vocalsound> back-lit buttons .\n",
      "Just so you know I think <disfmarker> I mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range .\n",
      "So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to ,\n",
      "though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components .\n",
      "I guess what I just want <disfmarker> to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached ,\n",
      "Let's let's try and think now , how much would you pay for\n",
      "But you've gotta think who our target market is\n",
      "I would say thirty five to forty .\n",
      "Yeah , I was gonna say thirty five to fifty .\n",
      "Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay .\n",
      "Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and and with a cradle , and yeah and the locator .\n",
      "With a cradle , radio transmitters , and back-lit buttons .\n",
      "The next meeting starts in thirty <vocalsound> minutes ,\n",
      "So we've got more than a thirty minutes .\n",
      "Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product ,\n",
      "And here's the agenda for this meeting .\n",
      "Uh I'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards .\n",
      "You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product\n",
      "And then we're gonna evaluate it .\n",
      "Then we're gonna talk about finance ,\n",
      "Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight Euros ,\n",
      "we implemented the basic functions ,\n",
      "which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator ,\n",
      "cradle ,\n",
      "scroll wheel for uh the <vocalsound> the channels ,\n",
      "and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll .\n",
      "Scrolling through your favourites list .\n",
      "I like the the the the logo on there as well .\n",
      "so this is the cradle unit ,\n",
      "Um so the scroll bar is <disfmarker> or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here ,\n",
      "This is the teletext .\n",
      "So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming <vocalsound> your uh the um the type of television you wanna use .\n",
      "So um the plastic is the white area of this <disfmarker> of the model here ,\n",
      "and the red area is like a rubber covering .\n",
      "and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um <disfmarker>\n",
      "could that be easy to <disfmarker> for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ?\n",
      "Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it <disfmarker>\n",
      "I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well .\n",
      "but I think we might scale down the final model a bit .\n",
      "So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote .\n",
      "And um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it ,\n",
      "we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger <disfmarker>\n",
      "but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there .\n",
      "And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so <disfmarker>\n",
      "But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling ,\n",
      "So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit ,\n",
      "But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that ,\n",
      "So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people .\n",
      "My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions .\n",
      "So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there\n",
      "I gotta do mine up at the board .\n",
      "No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it .\n",
      "And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh .\n",
      "And uh to me with this product we got uh <disfmarker> we got <vocalsound> basically three things to market .\n",
      "We've got the features ,\n",
      "we have the uh characteristics ,\n",
      "The the corporation stands behind the product , okay .\n",
      "we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um\n",
      "Beep beep beep .\n",
      "we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive .\n",
      "One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee ,\n",
      "it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros .\n",
      "We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche .\n",
      "would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ?\n",
      "for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that that we can go after this\n",
      "and at that cost I think it uh <disfmarker> there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together .\n",
      "The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only .\n",
      "There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my <disfmarker> but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ?\n",
      "W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less <disfmarker>\n",
      "b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons ,\n",
      "Okay so we can talk about finance now .\n",
      "So I have a little spreadsheet for us\n",
      "I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros ,\n",
      "which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already .\n",
      "Uh <vocalsound> and I'm assuming that the locator beacon ,\n",
      "uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display ,\n",
      "um I do think we that we we <vocalsound> uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print ,\n",
      "Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ?\n",
      "It's single-curved ,\n",
      "So we come <disfmarker> bring it down to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Fifteen point four .\n",
      "See it's a little bit more than f single-curved .\n",
      "So yeah it's fifteen point eight ,\n",
      "we haven't talked about any special colour though\n",
      "if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're <disfmarker>\n",
      "is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ?\n",
      "That's a scroll .\n",
      "then we have fifteen point eight Euros .\n",
      "We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation ,\n",
      "How how have we done today ?\n",
      "I think we did pretty well .\n",
      "No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept .\n",
      "Okay so th th what about um room for creativity ?\n",
      "Sh I think there was plenty of room .\n",
      "I think we we ended up being quite creative there .\n",
      "we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us\n",
      "yeah but <disfmarker> we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess ,\n",
      "It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was\n",
      "These cables suck <vocalsound> .\n",
      "So yeah the the pen came in alright\n",
      "and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works .\n",
      "What new ideas have we found ?\n",
      "Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r uh remote call feature .\n",
      "Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice .\n",
      "And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon .\n",
      "Are the costs within the budget ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "Not the original budget , but they are now .\n",
      "Is the project evaluated ?\n",
      "So we need to close this meeting ,\n",
      "I'm Ada Longmund ,\n",
      "and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager .\n",
      "Our project project is to create um a new remote control\n",
      "so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly .\n",
      "if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work\n",
      "and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other .\n",
      "Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . Uh .\n",
      "The tool training is to try out the white board ,\n",
      "Maybe someone ha we have to <gap> this whiteboard ,\n",
      "Maybe you can draw your favourite animal\n",
      "and make a list of its favourite characteristics .\n",
      "I don't know if we have to do it now ,\n",
      "maybe later later .\n",
      "the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I think it's quite good price , yeah .\n",
      "it will uh be a an international remote control ,\n",
      "and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes .\n",
      "try to create something new\n",
      "And <vocalsound> and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes ,\n",
      "you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role\n",
      "you will have to work on the design\n",
      "and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control\n",
      "and think of the user requirement specifications .\n",
      "Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think . AMI\n",
      "I_D_ is for the Industrial Design ,\n",
      "And U_I_D_ , it's for the User Interface Designer ,\n",
      "and Marketing Expert , it's me .\n",
      "I will manage all all the group .\n",
      "what's the difference between\n",
      "user interface design d industrial design ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "I suppose you have to design it\n",
      "and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it .\n",
      "I I think the user the user interface design is <disfmarker> he will design how the user will you know <disfmarker> the relation between the user and you know the remote control so <disfmarker>\n",
      "And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like .\n",
      "Maybe , it is the outside and the inside .\n",
      "'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know .\n",
      "I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have\n",
      "and then thi this would <vocalsound> I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer .\n",
      "so really the remote control to be international .\n",
      "And not too expensive .\n",
      "And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now .\n",
      "<vocalsound> There was a step about drawing something in the in the board ,\n",
      "Are we supposed to do right now ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "You can draw something which is very simple . <vocalsound>\n",
      "It's a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's a cat .\n",
      "you have to draw a rat if you want a rat .\n",
      "It's a rabbit .\n",
      "Right . A fish .\n",
      "we have break .\n",
      "present project ,\n",
      "we have twenty five minutes for the meeting .\n",
      "You know your job ?\n",
      "I have an idea of my job <vocalsound>\n",
      "I will open our functional design meeting .\n",
      "we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and um\n",
      "And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements ,\n",
      "I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer .\n",
      "Um , so you're participant two ?\n",
      "One one .\n",
      "I'm participant one . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Three three , it's three\n",
      "did you save your presentation ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "Isn't that technical functions ?\n",
      "it's David Jordan . Course .\n",
      "The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .\n",
      "remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very <disfmarker> has very soph sophisticated functions ,\n",
      "so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface .\n",
      "A very good example is Google .\n",
      "So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller <vocalsound>\n",
      "which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface .\n",
      "So you propose to to have the\n",
      "remote control which will be powerful .\n",
      "With sophisticated functions ,\n",
      "and very easy to use .\n",
      "it's maybe difficult to have both ,\n",
      "I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple\n",
      "But if we have very very good user interface\n",
      "it take less time for user to learn how to use it .\n",
      "but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright .\n",
      "As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control .\n",
      "I propose a nifra infrared base <vocalsound>\n",
      "I think it's cheaper than laser , so <vocalsound> .\n",
      "what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb ,\n",
      "I have some kind of pictures\n",
      "and you have the other subcomponent\n",
      "I think it should be wire <vocalsound> wireless re remote con <vocalsound>\n",
      "and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you .\n",
      "There's a wire <vocalsound> with remote control ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "So you think that uh <vocalsound> a cable between the remote control <vocalsound> and the T_V_ <vocalsound> <disfmarker> won't be a good idea .\n",
      "maybe it will be cheaper <vocalsound> I dunno\n",
      "but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?\n",
      "Do you think it will be cheaper ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> Could you answer please ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "Have to think about the question ,\n",
      "but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem .\n",
      "Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research\n",
      "If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?\n",
      "I think it's would be easier to have <vocalsound> a link between the remote control and the television ,\n",
      "So just trying to answer all the questions ,\n",
      "We had one hundred subjects ,\n",
      "um , we observe their remote control use in a lab\n",
      "and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um ,\n",
      "Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly ,\n",
      "Yeah , the the look is is bad for them\n",
      "Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly .\n",
      "And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so <disfmarker> doesn't fit the user requirements sometime ,\n",
      "because it's too many buttons and so on .\n",
      "And uh users are actually zapping a lot ,\n",
      "ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control .\n",
      "remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .\n",
      "Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people .\n",
      "And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users .\n",
      "R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um <disfmarker> doing the same movement several times , then you get injured .\n",
      "Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs .\n",
      "If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent ,\n",
      "And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons ,\n",
      "And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ?\n",
      "Yeah , I think possible .\n",
      "Because we can <disfmarker> We can uh mix uh several function in one button .\n",
      "but do you think it will be easy to use ?\n",
      "Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .\n",
      "you you can have a switch menu ,\n",
      "but it has to be intuitive .\n",
      "For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_\n",
      "and also you can control your uh recorder .\n",
      "But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny <disfmarker> look fancy , not funny .\n",
      "Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know .\n",
      "I think the solution is to have many colours of <disfmarker> you know instead of having one grey standard <disfmarker>\n",
      "but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .\n",
      "Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options ,\n",
      "so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .\n",
      "new information about the product requirements ,\n",
      "the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore ,\n",
      "because now everybody has internet at home ,\n",
      "so it's better to use internet then teletext .\n",
      "and also the remote control will only be used for television ,\n",
      "you won't had <vocalsound> um buttons to just to manipulate <disfmarker> yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that .\n",
      "which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex\n",
      "So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy .\n",
      "And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan .\n",
      "So has to be yellow .\n",
      "As we say , we put the fashion in electronics ,\n",
      "so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .\n",
      "Require lot of requirements ,\n",
      "but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web .\n",
      "There's that box in the T_V_ ,\n",
      "so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ .\n",
      "I don't think it's popular ,\n",
      "I think it has to be yellow .\n",
      "I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Or should be .\n",
      "Doesn't need to be completely yellow ,\n",
      "Regarding the first line , what <disfmarker> So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext .\n",
      "But <disfmarker> I dunno , but why ,\n",
      "I think it would be simpler .\n",
      "I will close the meeting ,\n",
      "um just after that we'll have lunch break .\n",
      "And you will have in thirty minutes individual work .\n",
      "You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um <disfmarker> pon\n",
      "Component component , yeah .\n",
      "and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept .\n",
      "And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .\n",
      "I think the um session is closed .\n",
      "And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder . <vocalsound> Not in mine .\n",
      "let's start our second me meeting on <vocalsound> conceptual design .\n",
      "and we will have three presentations\n",
      "and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept\n",
      "I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan .\n",
      "Um there's three concepts in the user interface .\n",
      "So first one it's a Google controller .\n",
      "The second is a fancy controller .\n",
      "The last one is uh intelligent controller .\n",
      "the first is Google controller .\n",
      "I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions .\n",
      "The second concept is a fancy controller ,\n",
      "we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive ,\n",
      "the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um\n",
      "Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I'm not sure the one in the middle <vocalsound> is very attractive .\n",
      "We'll have big discussion I suppose after that ,\n",
      "the last uh concept is intelligent .\n",
      "so maybe we should uh use um uh\n",
      "technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology ,\n",
      "so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um\n",
      "With this advanced features we <disfmarker> I think we can attract a lot of user .\n",
      "because for the intelligent controller , <vocalsound> you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition ,\n",
      "but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels .\n",
      "Do you think they will be able to use gestures ?\n",
      "Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ?\n",
      "or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while .\n",
      "Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button .\n",
      "For example , if you cannot find your uh <vocalsound> controller , you can just uh <vocalsound> just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two .\n",
      "but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller .\n",
      "but how how is <disfmarker> how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ?\n",
      "For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very <disfmarker>\n",
      "but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ?\n",
      "so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time ,\n",
      "that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller .\n",
      "Even you h you have the controller , I can <vocalsound> I can say channel three ,\n",
      "No , but this is disadvant disadvantage .\n",
      "And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to\n",
      "How how much will it cost ?\n",
      "more expensive maybe .\n",
      "we don't have to do some basic research on this field .\n",
      "y y you have also the language problem ,\n",
      "'Cause it it have to be universal ,\n",
      "The vocabulary is very small ,\n",
      "but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international\n",
      "The recognition system will be able to understand French .\n",
      "this could be downloaded by the web maybe ,\n",
      "And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?\n",
      "Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to <disfmarker>\n",
      "Seems to be quite complex .\n",
      "It it just <disfmarker> the microphone is embedded in the controller .\n",
      "but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object .\n",
      "If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object .\n",
      "you <disfmarker> so you can build a kind of black box\n",
      "and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice .\n",
      "do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ?\n",
      "think it <disfmarker> we should give the uh flexibility to the user\n",
      "You can see <disfmarker> they can switch form one modality to another .\n",
      "It's a bit risky risky .\n",
      "But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem ,\n",
      "I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition .\n",
      "I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller\n",
      "and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller .\n",
      "Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ?\n",
      "stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ?\n",
      "so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?\n",
      "Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that <disfmarker>\n",
      "we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so <disfmarker> or something like that .\n",
      "you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller ,\n",
      "but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile ,\n",
      "the feature is not one hundred percent reliable ,\n",
      "but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our <disfmarker> from other products .\n",
      "but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone .\n",
      "so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot .\n",
      "if he has something that works fine and is really <vocalsound> fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use .\n",
      "But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller .\n",
      "let's go to the Industrial Designer .\n",
      "Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that ,\n",
      "Uh I think there's something wrong with your <disfmarker>\n",
      "It did didn't r receive it . Didn't receive it .\n",
      "Maybe you you record it somewhere else .\n",
      "I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation .\n",
      "It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r\n",
      "So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside\n",
      "something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use ,\n",
      "will <disfmarker> it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control\n",
      "or a a plastic remote control like this one .\n",
      "in which which which kind will be the the different bu button ,\n",
      "it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one ,\n",
      "or you have also some button like L_C_D_\n",
      "the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have ,\n",
      "so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation\n",
      "or will it be a battery like the classical battery\n",
      "for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come\n",
      "and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers\n",
      "but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more ,\n",
      "if we want to have battery , regular battery and and <vocalsound> the solar energy battery it could be <disfmarker> it'll it will add a little bit of the price ,\n",
      "the plastic material is more common\n",
      "but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class ,\n",
      "and i if you <disfmarker> we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .\n",
      "the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive ,\n",
      "but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module .\n",
      "and <disfmarker> so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough .\n",
      "I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know <vocalsound> lighted buttons\n",
      "What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example .\n",
      "It's it's expensive I I guess .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think we have only <vocalsound> <vocalsound> uh five minutes left .\n",
      "trend watching .\n",
      "just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market\n",
      "and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market ,\n",
      "Um user really really want a fancy look and feel .\n",
      "Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and <disfmarker> I mean <vocalsound> i i it sounds good technically\n",
      "second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative ,\n",
      "so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .\n",
      "At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use .\n",
      "that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis .\n",
      "Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,\n",
      "so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .\n",
      "And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance .\n",
      "Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three .\n",
      "Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones .\n",
      "And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch ,\n",
      "this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design .\n",
      "but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?\n",
      "plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh\n",
      "we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy .\n",
      "maybe using solar energy and <disfmarker> with battery would be something interesting ,\n",
      "Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well .\n",
      "Something spongy . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> No wood\n",
      "I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know .\n",
      "It's it's natural .\n",
      "so maybe we can stay with wood .\n",
      "But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons ,\n",
      "Uh and what about the user interface concept ?\n",
      "Google and fancy ?\n",
      "Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this .\n",
      "the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually ,\n",
      "So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller ,\n",
      "maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .\n",
      "And L_C_D_ buttons .\n",
      "I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add .\n",
      "commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers .\n",
      "Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four .\n",
      "Not very complex commands , but easy commands ,\n",
      "Yeah , simple ones\n",
      "we'll <disfmarker> you will all have to work in in your direction .\n",
      "So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition .\n",
      "Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons <vocalsound>\n",
      "and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too .\n",
      "So you will have <disfmarker> Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype\n",
      "and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control ,\n",
      "And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .\n",
      "Okay .\n",
      "we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> and our Industrial Designer , Baba .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red .\n",
      "And the shape , there's two basic shape .\n",
      "The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece .\n",
      "It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design .\n",
      "So there are several key features of our pr prototype .\n",
      "The first is that it is fuzzy .\n",
      "I'm sure this would be the unique design the market .\n",
      "the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection .\n",
      "Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base .\n",
      "So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel\n",
      "Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh <vocalsound> like lemon shape , you know ,\n",
      "Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends .\n",
      "Fruits and vegetables .\n",
      "And inspired colour\n",
      "and <vocalsound> and very sophisticated material , so .\n",
      "the low level chips inside\n",
      "The battery it is under <gap> .\n",
      "It is in th in <disfmarker> in the base , yeah . <vocalsound>\n",
      "In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , the shape is unique ,\n",
      "Maybe if you change <disfmarker> if you take the buttons out ,\n",
      "I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or <disfmarker>\n",
      "Looks like more fruit .\n",
      "It looks <vocalsound> more like a pineapple .\n",
      "If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel .\n",
      "<vocalsound> <vocalsound> And where is the voice recognition ?\n",
      "Ah , it's embedded , your microphone .\n",
      "First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel .\n",
      "let's say it's a pineapple now . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> No , the colour is okay , that's fine .\n",
      "but I would say there is more <disfmarker> too much red .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Right . So , from one to seven ?\n",
      "Three .\n",
      "The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative .\n",
      "There four microphone .\n",
      "And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ?\n",
      "Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah .\n",
      "And I think you <disfmarker> you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single .\n",
      "We have tactile buttons .\n",
      "I see , you have microphone array embedded .\n",
      "I think technically it's acceptable , so <disfmarker>\n",
      "I would say two\n",
      "is it easy to use ?\n",
      "Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy .\n",
      "Yeah but this this turning <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ?\n",
      "and you can turn like that to change the channel ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to <disfmarker> if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ?\n",
      "Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult .\n",
      "then the angle you stop is the angle you <disfmarker> is the channel you <disfmarker>\n",
      "How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ?\n",
      "It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the <disfmarker>\n",
      "I think b but the the vocal command is easy too .\n",
      "So it's coarse to fine design .\n",
      "that's very technologic , so . <vocalsound> Yeah .\n",
      "yeah it's a sleeping remote control .\n",
      "Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah .\n",
      "W that why we have the solar ti yeah .\n",
      "<vocalsound> To compensate <gap> .\n",
      "it's reasonable three . <vocalsound>\n",
      "those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me .\n",
      "I think it's easier than traditional controller .\n",
      "you have <disfmarker> you just turn the turn the ball .\n",
      "But this this has to stay on the table , right ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> In fact on a flat place <disfmarker>\n",
      "You need to have everything in hand .\n",
      "If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn .\n",
      "You know tha that's the weak point ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah .\n",
      "Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so .\n",
      "It need maybe some wo further work , but it's <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , especially on the easy to use\n",
      "But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple .\n",
      "we need to calculate the production cost .\n",
      "As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros .\n",
      "but we have solar cells .\n",
      "Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ?\n",
      "Uh I think in each ball you have three <disfmarker>\n",
      "Single simple chip on print ?\n",
      "And sample sensor , sample speaker .\n",
      "Mm . One maybe , yeah .\n",
      "So we are all already nineteen .\n",
      "The solar cell is too expensive . <vocalsound>\n",
      "There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think .\n",
      "I think it's more like double curved .\n",
      "We have two special colours .\n",
      "Push button .\n",
      "Mm . Yeah , we have four .\n",
      "Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel .\n",
      "Okay we <disfmarker> I think we have problem . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I think we s if we keep on adding things <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells .\n",
      "Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ?\n",
      "We have change the electronics to <disfmarker> from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . Oh .\n",
      "I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe .\n",
      "We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black .\n",
      "An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button .\n",
      "Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think there's a problem with the push push button .\n",
      "So we have one button ,\n",
      "<gap> One s one scroll wheel , so\n",
      "So , yeah . It think we we've done good job , as the cost is\n",
      "It's fine , twelve fifty uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be <disfmarker>\n",
      "It's <disfmarker> it is really really uh really very very expensive , though .\n",
      "Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . <vocalsound>\n",
      "So did you enjoy your clay modelling ?\n",
      "Yes . Of course . This is my job . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to <disfmarker> from the beginning to the end .\n",
      "And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very <vocalsound> informative for <gap> .\n",
      "Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe .\n",
      "'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff\n",
      "next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it <disfmarker> um .\n",
      "Could we come up with new T_V_ with <disfmarker> such as this kind of T_V_ ?\n",
      "You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device .\n",
      "'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh .\n",
      "But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product .\n",
      "We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know .\n",
      "So I think the costs are within the budget .\n",
      "do you think you can celebrate your creation ?\n",
      "And you can celebrate your leadership . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know .\n",
      "Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still .\n",
      "It's <disfmarker> yeah but it <disfmarker> I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere .\n",
      "Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ <disfmarker>\n",
      "So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ .\n",
      "So we have give him <disfmarker> give it a cute name .\n",
      "<vocalsound> It's a pineapple remote controls .\n",
      "and we have a nearly final product .\n",
      "So , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes .\n",
      "Um so I will be uh Sebastian the Project Manager .\n",
      "I'm uh Michael . I'm the user interface designer .\n",
      "Hi I'm Guillermo <gap> . I'm the Marketing Expert .\n",
      "And I am Hemant , the industrial designer .\n",
      "Um so let's have a look to the the agenda .\n",
      "uh and mainly first to uh <vocalsound> to make <disfmarker> to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here .\n",
      "Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it .\n",
      "So , the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control .\n",
      "Um it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly .\n",
      "As usual we will follow the the project method um <vocalsound> that we are using in the <disfmarker> in our company .\n",
      "It is in three step as you know .\n",
      "First the functional design .\n",
      "The second's a conceptual design ,\n",
      "and then the detailed design .\n",
      "During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately , individually on uh your specific tasks\n",
      "and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next .\n",
      "so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings .\n",
      "Okay so , want me to draw my favourite animal .\n",
      "Well , I don't really have a favourite animal , but um\n",
      "<vocalsound> I'm gonna <vocalsound> <gap> about the uh spider\n",
      "I dunno why , but <vocalsound> when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther\n",
      "So , not the favourite animal , but I think I'll draw elephant .\n",
      "Do we have some message there ?\n",
      "I have to catch you ,\n",
      "We have to to go through the meeting .\n",
      "We can discuss that off-line .\n",
      "so another important part of the project is about money ,\n",
      "So <vocalsound> we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control\n",
      "which which would generate a profit of of um <vocalsound> fifty million Euros , okay .\n",
      "And we should target the inter an international market .\n",
      "is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ?\n",
      "So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go .\n",
      "should it be um specific remote control to some specific device ?\n",
      "Should it be a universal one ?\n",
      "so , it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make ,\n",
      "but I guess if that's <disfmarker> if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket\n",
      "So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go .\n",
      "So we need to close the meeting .\n",
      "So um you have to work on the on the working design ,\n",
      "you have to uh work on the technical functions ,\n",
      "and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs ,\n",
      "Um you will receive some information by emails , i as usual .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Okay , let's have a look to the agenda today .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So , we are going to have a meeting about the functional design .\n",
      "Um so first before starting I w just going to uh to go quickly to <disfmarker> through the minutes of previous meeting .\n",
      "So uh <vocalsound> basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control ,\n",
      "but I have new um new i inputs for <disfmarker> about that topics .\n",
      "I goin I'm going to share with you .\n",
      "so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations .\n",
      "But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of <disfmarker> to give a name to the project .\n",
      "So , I just put d quickly Remo ,\n",
      "Any ideas ?\n",
      "Uh the Powerstick .\n",
      "Maybe a Spanish name would work well .\n",
      "Mando .\n",
      "What does it mean in Spanish ?\n",
      "Control .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So , let's go for Mando ?\n",
      "you could have the fonts you know special ,\n",
      "Although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though ,\n",
      "I I think this is more a question of of look and feel .\n",
      "Something that should be addressed later\n",
      "We should we should go to other <disfmarker> for the other topics .\n",
      "So maybe we could start with the market , yeah .\n",
      "and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls .\n",
      "And also I di I did a study with <disfmarker> for the incorporation of new technologies\n",
      "Well <vocalsound> <vocalsound> more <disfmarker> most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly .\n",
      "So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control ,\n",
      "the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control .\n",
      "So <vocalsound> <vocalsound> in my opinion the Mando <disfmarker> this Mando shouldn't be very small\n",
      "So it may be interesting to to think in a <disfmarker> in both prototypes , for right and left handed people .\n",
      "Well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person .\n",
      "Well maybe it could be a universal design .\n",
      "And finally , the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting ,\n",
      "but I don't know if the budget would be large enough .\n",
      "But most of <disfmarker> yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology .\n",
      "We had the new requirements from the <disfmarker> so uh from the head offices of the company ,\n",
      "and so they wanted <disfmarker> so they want to um <disfmarker> they would like to be restricted to T_V_ .\n",
      "So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now\n",
      "and uh finally , <vocalsound> it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I was still uh I was still working on this uh twenty five Euro price point\n",
      "because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low uh price\n",
      "I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult\n",
      "because if you think <disfmarker> if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the <disfmarker>\n",
      "it could be command control kind of thing .\n",
      "It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated .\n",
      "Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote ,\n",
      "and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site .\n",
      "and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant ,\n",
      "well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen\n",
      "But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control , and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it ,\n",
      "I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel .\n",
      "because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro ,\n",
      "but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen\n",
      "this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple ,\n",
      "So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons ,\n",
      "but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons .\n",
      "Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . Um\n",
      "if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way .\n",
      "because w if people see a remo see the <disfmarker> see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to <disfmarker> very different build <disfmarker> very different to the traditional <disfmarker>\n",
      "Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this <disfmarker> a programme driven interface rather than the channel number .\n",
      "the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily .\n",
      "and maybe we wanna make it something that's <vocalsound> extensible to do other tasks .\n",
      "Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on ,\n",
      "user i interface could be of two types ,\n",
      "one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing <disfmarker> doing some he is knowing about that technology .\n",
      "and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being <disfmarker> sitting on the on the remote .\n",
      "but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel .\n",
      "And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote .\n",
      "That increases the the cost also .\n",
      "Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well <disfmarker> of such technologies is enough ?\n",
      "Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones\n",
      "<vocalsound> Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though ,\n",
      "my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control .\n",
      "I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo <vocalsound> everyone will s will buy it .\n",
      "<vocalsound> <vocalsound> Actually I'm not so sure\n",
      "you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm <disfmarker> instead of pressing up on on a remote control .\n",
      "we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy ,\n",
      "which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big .\n",
      "We should bring new technologies for young peoples ,\n",
      "So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_\n",
      "<vocalsound> and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies .\n",
      "you say we're focusing on T_V_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ?\n",
      "well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ?\n",
      "For twenty five Euro ? <vocalsound> I think it's impossible .\n",
      "because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control ,\n",
      "So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh\n",
      "of increasing the unit price .\n",
      "what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ?\n",
      "So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ?\n",
      "So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to .\n",
      "so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the T_V_ , or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to <disfmarker>\n",
      "Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ?\n",
      "we don't go for speech recognition technology .\n",
      "The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion .\n",
      "I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the <disfmarker> than the L_C_D_ .\n",
      "I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a <disfmarker> you know .\n",
      "But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars ,\n",
      "Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ?\n",
      "I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> so you have to work on the component uh concept .\n",
      "Uh you have to work on user interface ,\n",
      "and you have to go through a trend watching .\n",
      "So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing .\n",
      "So today is um our third meeting .\n",
      "It will be about the conceptual design <vocalsound> uh .\n",
      "um . We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons\n",
      "and we are not decided about u the use of L_C_D_ screen on on the remote control because of costs .\n",
      "Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point .\n",
      "So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform\n",
      "I investigate deeper the preference of the users .\n",
      "What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device .\n",
      "After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking ,\n",
      "what they what they find more more interesting , more <disfmarker> or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel .\n",
      "So now more more cool aspect , ma more <disfmarker> a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with <disfmarker>\n",
      "instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to to watch , to see .\n",
      "all this fashion it's <vocalsound> it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables .\n",
      "And also <vocalsound> in the in the U_S_A_ the the current <disfmarker> the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy .\n",
      "What what do you mean by <vocalsound> fruit and vegetables and spongy ?\n",
      "I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes .\n",
      "So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana ,\n",
      "Vegetable textures and all this kind .\n",
      "So which fruit are you thinking of ?\n",
      "<gap> I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit ,\n",
      "but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may <disfmarker> could remind some kind of vegetable ,\n",
      "instead of vegetable , some natur mm uh natural object or something .\n",
      "or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the <disfmarker> <gap>\n",
      "No , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different .\n",
      "I'm not , I'm not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though ,\n",
      "like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner ,\n",
      "Is fruit cool ?\n",
      "Okay , but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know ,\n",
      "Well , probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of ,\n",
      "a cucumber .\n",
      "Maybe too long .\n",
      "and you you you will not have pla enough <disfmarker> a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also .\n",
      "Uh do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "and also it's <disfmarker> I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_\n",
      "you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons <disfmarker> with only a few buttons .\n",
      "So you are User Interface guy .\n",
      "Okay . So I received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit ,\n",
      "It means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that .\n",
      "I guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control .\n",
      "but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done .\n",
      "Is this a technology that recognize keywords <disfmarker> speech keywords ?\n",
      "it's it'll recognize uh I guess keywords , but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase .\n",
      "So this is not s really to do to to do control .\n",
      "It's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing ,\n",
      "<disfmarker> yeah comp <vocalsound> completely pointless <vocalsound> for the inter for <disfmarker> from the interaction point of v point of view <gap> .\n",
      "So this is out of discussion .\n",
      "I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine , so <disfmarker>\n",
      "I've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our <vocalsound> potential funky-looking uh remote control <disfmarker>\n",
      "But um , I've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> But I think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume ,\n",
      "I've also included this turbo button\n",
      "because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button ,\n",
      "so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if uh , you know , if I'm if I'm going <disfmarker> if I'm scrolling past them\n",
      "but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , um .\n",
      "it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana\n",
      "well , I guess you need an on and off switch ,\n",
      "but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know ,\n",
      "So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing .\n",
      "I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so .\n",
      "No we can we can't use that .\n",
      "Well , I f I think it's probably more than , than our <gap> can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning .\n",
      "I don't I don't know if that speech recognition is , you know , even if we can do it , I think it's not really appropriate for uh television environment .\n",
      "It might be useful to have some kind of base station ,\n",
      "even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote .\n",
      "So this is going to be about the component design .\n",
      "So first thing is we need power source for the remote control .\n",
      "So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies ,\n",
      "one is the usual batteries which are there ,\n",
      "they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing\n",
      "and on top of that we can have solar cells ,\n",
      "when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind .\n",
      "Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your <disfmarker> if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces ,\n",
      "I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy .\n",
      "and then it should be double curve .\n",
      "The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve .\n",
      "with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve .\n",
      "but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one ,\n",
      "it'll bring the cost down\n",
      "Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood .\n",
      "but are we set on the banana idea ?\n",
      "the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy .\n",
      "Yes it is .\n",
      "Yeah , okay , so capsicum or pepper . Yeah .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I don't know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like\n",
      "But <gap> like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top\n",
      "Okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated ,\n",
      "Then uh there are different kind of chips ,\n",
      "one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip .\n",
      "Pricing is a factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip .\n",
      "So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana ?\n",
      "Uh , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better .\n",
      "or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place ,\n",
      "so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_ ,\n",
      "It depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device .\n",
      "So you're having the basis station and there is a button ,\n",
      "if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is . Uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think that's a pretty handy feature .\n",
      "Yeah but I'm a bit worried about the budget . <gap>\n",
      "basis station is nothing more , just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits .\n",
      "L_C_D_ has already been ruled out , A_S_R_ has been ruled out .\n",
      "I'm just wondering actually , 'cause , you know , I <disfmarker> this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's um it seemed like <disfmarker> it first seems a bit kind of uh niche , like only a few people would really want a banana ,\n",
      "but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana ?\n",
      "You know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver .\n",
      "If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana .\n",
      "maybe <disfmarker> like still in the shape of a banana .\n",
      "Um , but you know , just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana\n",
      "Before before st before ending the meeting I'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype .\n",
      "So we need to take some de decisions about um <vocalsound> about what we're going to do .\n",
      "so we're going for a stylish banana shape .\n",
      "<vocalsound> We'll have a base station extra uh on the side .\n",
      "Uh , we have a R_F_ for um for beeping for beeping .\n",
      "So we <disfmarker> that means we need a button on th on the on the basis .\n",
      "and your tur turbo turbo uh button .\n",
      "Yeah , which <disfmarker> I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device ,\n",
      "And and you have two wheels .\n",
      "Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well .\n",
      "Well , I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote\n",
      "But you know our targets are very high , means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make .\n",
      "You have to uh work on the look and feel uh design\n",
      "and you have to work on the user interface ,\n",
      "in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype .\n",
      "Uh Marketing Expert uh have to go to product evaluation .\n",
      "So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of <disfmarker> detail design of the product of the remote control .\n",
      "Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting\n",
      "then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two ,\n",
      "And we'll have um <vocalsound> presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts .\n",
      "Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing\n",
      "and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro .\n",
      "No L_C_D_ , no speech recognition technology , okay ,\n",
      "we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost .\n",
      "So final design . Final design .\n",
      "well first first of all we made a an attractive <vocalsound> base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh\n",
      "the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over\n",
      "We've got the two uh <vocalsound> uh scroll wheels here\n",
      "which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel\n",
      "and uh underneath <vocalsound> we have the uh the turbo button\n",
      "What's the use uh of the t turbo button already ?\n",
      "This is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh <disfmarker> through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you <disfmarker> quickly rather th\n",
      "Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops .\n",
      "If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_ .\n",
      "This is a teletext button .\n",
      "once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And this is the uh the infrared uh port .\n",
      "in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana .\n",
      "And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ?\n",
      "And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries\n",
      "and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries .\n",
      "It's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana .\n",
      "And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana .\n",
      "I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station .\n",
      "Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ?\n",
      "No eight or eight or ten hours of working .\n",
      "If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer .\n",
      "Pricing is <disfmarker> was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip .\n",
      "And what about people who want to use digits ?\n",
      "Yeah . So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape .\n",
      "So we have to go through now evaluations .\n",
      "I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements .\n",
      "so we must users must say i if it's true or is <disfmarker> or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven .\n",
      "Why this strange factor of seven ?\n",
      "Because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale ,\n",
      "I think I sh I <vocalsound> I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ?\n",
      "Okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , it's fancy , according to me .\n",
      "Seven . Seven by me .\n",
      "Yeah uh five .\n",
      "like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels\n",
      "but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason\n",
      "Functional .\n",
      "I'll give five .\n",
      "Well it depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or d does what it does , you know , can it make you coffee ?\n",
      "Actually I don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro\n",
      "Well it's not a universal remote .\n",
      "Four .\n",
      "<vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay cool ? Cool device .\n",
      "There I'll give it seven .\n",
      "For a T_V_ the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature .\n",
      "I would say five .\n",
      "I say <disfmarker> I said seven .\n",
      "Of course I'll buy the <gap> banana . <gap>\n",
      "I'll say five .\n",
      "I find it quite cheap <vocalsound> actually .\n",
      "I dunno . If i i it depends , if you live in in Switzerland or you live in <disfmarker>\n",
      "Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or <disfmarker>\n",
      "<vocalsound> I don't want a banana on my <vocalsound> living room table , a banana remote .\n",
      "Anyb anybody who comes here <vocalsound> <disfmarker> anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this .\n",
      "don't forget who we're targeting also\n",
      "<vocalsound> No , it's I . I would buy <disfmarker>\n",
      "I don't think I <disfmarker> at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control , really .\n",
      "So you say two .\n",
      "I say five .\n",
      "If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro , if that was like my limit , maybe I would buy it .\n",
      "I stick to five .\n",
      "will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana .\n",
      "No uh let's say I'll put two .\n",
      "If it was <disfmarker> change my remote control of my D_V_D_ player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to\n",
      "I'd say a three .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So it's somewhere three point five I think .\n",
      "So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling . We can had uh have a <disfmarker> out of these numbers , which which is that well we should go for it .\n",
      "Um well we are going to calculate the production costs .\n",
      "We should we should be below twelve point five .\n",
      "Well we decided against the solar cells so <disfmarker>\n",
      "I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing .\n",
      "No kinetic also .\n",
      "So we have the regular chip on the print , which is one .\n",
      "And we have sample speaker .\n",
      "Well actually that that <disfmarker> no that sample speaker is not <disfmarker> we we're not using that ,\n",
      "we're just using the the very beep <disfmarker> simple beep ,\n",
      "Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing .\n",
      "So we we'll put some extras , if there is something .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I put single curved .\n",
      "To reduce the cost , it's okay .\n",
      "So we stick to plastic , it cost nothing .\n",
      "Well <gap> <disfmarker> no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber <disfmarker>\n",
      "<vocalsound> Too expensive .\n",
      "Okay so special colour , yellow .\n",
      "We don't have any push buttons .\n",
      "We have three .\n",
      "We have two scroll , and we have three push buttons .\n",
      "Okay it's gonna have to be plastic .\n",
      "but you know the turbo button does add that extra class .\n",
      "So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that .\n",
      "Make it plastic instead of rubber .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of <vocalsound> plastic .\n",
      "So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which <disfmarker> the cord and everything which'll go <disfmarker>\n",
      "so we have margin for that stuff .\n",
      "So what do we do with the extra profits ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um we'll invest in R_ and D_ .\n",
      "So we can go to <disfmarker> through to project evaluation .\n",
      "No we have a product which none of us would buy . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> Okay so um <vocalsound> project process .\n",
      "Well in fact I I did not know <vocalsound> I didn't know really what to say here .\n",
      "Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen , not that much .\n",
      "I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And uh but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um <vocalsound> like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting .\n",
      "Yeah maybe we should go through , yeah an uh evaluation .\n",
      "Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of\n",
      "pointless .\n",
      "So but I think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market .\n",
      "I think that's actually something that should be in version two , is the ability to you know to control things other than the T_V_\n",
      "I think we we can go\n",
      "<gap> Okay so thanks very much .\n",
      "Uh , we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control .\n",
      "So I'm going to be the project manager of this uh project .\n",
      "I'm Fabien Cardinaux\n",
      "and uh I I guess you can present yourself .\n",
      "so my name is Petre <gap> .\n",
      "Uh , in the project I'm supposed to be the technic .\n",
      "'Kay . So my name's Bob Morris .\n",
      "I'm the Marketing Expert for this project .\n",
      "My name is Hamed Getabdar ,\n",
      "and uh I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project .\n",
      "We are talking about the project plan ,\n",
      "Um . So what is the goal of this project ? Is to design a new remote control .\n",
      "So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities\n",
      "and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way .\n",
      "Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all <disfmarker> during all this project .\n",
      "For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it .\n",
      "So I will ask you all to do the same .\n",
      "Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal ?\n",
      "Yeah , yeah , you can draw the picture , of course <vocalsound> .\n",
      "Uh we are going to to sell <disfmarker> we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro .\n",
      "And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro .\n",
      "And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world .\n",
      "We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro .\n",
      "Um , so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ?\n",
      "Well , from experience , um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very <disfmarker> they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small ,\n",
      "and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons ,\n",
      "you know , on a T_V_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . Um .\n",
      "Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light <vocalsound> ,\n",
      "so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light .\n",
      "And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh <disfmarker> there are two buttons for volume control .\n",
      "But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like .\n",
      "<gap> Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could <gap> <disfmarker> the the volume can go up very quickly\n",
      "Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards ,\n",
      "I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves ,\n",
      "because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune <gap> .\n",
      "So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes .\n",
      "Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control ,\n",
      "you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control .\n",
      "Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes .\n",
      "Uh so we will see our three presentations .\n",
      "Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device .\n",
      "Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control .\n",
      "So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market .\n",
      "seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly .\n",
      "Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user ,\n",
      "Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls .\n",
      "And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most <disfmarker> by far the most used buttons on the remote control .\n",
      "And basically they came <disfmarker> they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users ,\n",
      "And fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it .\n",
      "In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display ,\n",
      "and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control .\n",
      "Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes .\n",
      "So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market .\n",
      "And speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive .\n",
      "And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think ,\n",
      "so I think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote .\n",
      "Okay , so here is my presentation about technical function design .\n",
      "Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands .\n",
      "And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands\n",
      "and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air\n",
      "Okay , <vocalsound> uh about <disfmarker> what I found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh , usually there are two different methods uh to <disfmarker> for designing a remote control .\n",
      "They are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves .\n",
      "uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with <disfmarker> uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way .\n",
      "And uh uh again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see .\n",
      "Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ?\n",
      "Uh , I don't think so ,\n",
      "And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same <disfmarker> have our remote control , for example ?\n",
      "but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it\n",
      "I have only a couple of things because I had <disfmarker> I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company .\n",
      "so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication <disfmarker> for the I_R_ circuits and so on ,\n",
      "And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there ,\n",
      "So , I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves\n",
      "but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on\n",
      "and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_\n",
      "well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ ,\n",
      "But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the <disfmarker> what does it offer , you know .\n",
      "If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle\n",
      "And uh my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit ,\n",
      "but from the point of view uh of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s .\n",
      "And the price is fairly cheap for this .\n",
      "because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red .\n",
      "But I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are <disfmarker> prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves .\n",
      "So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . Um\n",
      "Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext .\n",
      "Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices ,\n",
      "the third one is uh about the the the image of the company .\n",
      "So um uh we should we should keep uh <disfmarker> The the product should be recognisable .\n",
      "It's <disfmarker> That mean we should use the colour of our company\n",
      "and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is uh , we put fashion of <disfmarker> in electronics .\n",
      "So now we we should take the decision what we are going to <disfmarker> what function we will have on this uh on this remote control .\n",
      "Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need .\n",
      "And then we can move on to the more advanced features .\n",
      "I think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button .\n",
      "So , turning channel , of course . Volume setting .\n",
      "will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ?\n",
      "Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number .\n",
      "so so we keep all these all these buttons .\n",
      "Maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and <disfmarker>\n",
      "If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus .\n",
      "So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you <disfmarker>\n",
      "We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel .\n",
      "So we've got channel and volume . Um .\n",
      "I mean there's always <disfmarker> we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> We should hide them somewhere .\n",
      "I mean a power button's obviously\n",
      "uh required .\n",
      "<vocalsound> This I was thinking . Do we need a power button at all ?\n",
      "Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ?\n",
      "Uh , well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off .\n",
      "Okay , so we should keep this button .\n",
      "so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff ,\n",
      "Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be <disfmarker>\n",
      "A button is better .\n",
      "What about things like the clock and um timers ?\n",
      "If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that ,\n",
      "I mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ?\n",
      "Probably not .\n",
      "W In my opinion we should have only useful thing\n",
      "So , um . So now we are going for for a small lunch .\n",
      "And uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works .\n",
      "And uh you are going to work on your individual works .\n",
      "And uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on .\n",
      "Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept\n",
      "and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be ,\n",
      "we will have again three presentation , from all of you ,\n",
      "and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions .\n",
      "Okay . Um so basically I just want to presented to you <disfmarker> present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . Um\n",
      "so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority .\n",
      "Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative .\n",
      "Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture .\n",
      "And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy .\n",
      "I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature .\n",
      "Okay . So I am going to talk about <disfmarker> a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use .\n",
      "So , the more frequent buttons should be larger ,\n",
      "they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control .\n",
      "And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it .\n",
      "Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can <disfmarker> which should be taken easily in hand .\n",
      "And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy .\n",
      "so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels ,\n",
      "Uh . And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier .\n",
      "And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good .\n",
      "but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy .\n",
      "that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers\n",
      "seven seven inch T_ <disfmarker> T_F_T_ screen ,\n",
      "which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there .\n",
      "So there will be some circuit uh for the power .\n",
      "Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries\n",
      "And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy ,\n",
      "which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything .\n",
      "Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres ,\n",
      "And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone , which is somewhere ,\n",
      "Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ?\n",
      "A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically .\n",
      "Well , sponginess . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes <disfmarker> if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe ,\n",
      "Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside .\n",
      "Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around .\n",
      "how big is it in reality ?\n",
      "Uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ?\n",
      "Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal .\n",
      "But I I think we can we can cut it .\n",
      "So so for the same price we have four screens now <vocalsound> .\n",
      "Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something .\n",
      "Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know .\n",
      "I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something .\n",
      "so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions .\n",
      "Uh first I think energy it's a key problem\n",
      "If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_ ,\n",
      "so no problem in energy , I think .\n",
      "So if we use s solar cells , um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ?\n",
      "I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large .\n",
      "Could you re could you redesign your board ?\n",
      "I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible .\n",
      "Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible .\n",
      "So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers .\n",
      "So let's go for a small L_C_D_ .\n",
      "My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the <disfmarker> it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company .\n",
      "I dunno if it can fit with the technology .\n",
      "The screen has to be <vocalsound> square ?\n",
      "But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so .\n",
      "It's like more more expensive to have shape like that .\n",
      "I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen .\n",
      "So we are agree with the banana thing ?\n",
      "So , <gap> the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess .\n",
      "Yeah , peeling of the banana .\n",
      "should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden .\n",
      "Is it is it possible to do that ?\n",
      "I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that ,\n",
      "If you see it's like peeling . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor .\n",
      "it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh <vocalsound> materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely .\n",
      "And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ?\n",
      "Mm . Likes . Soft plastic , or <disfmarker>\n",
      "So we add also the speech recognition device .\n",
      "Um , so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design .\n",
      "The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device .\n",
      "And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation .\n",
      "uh I think you should work together , s you uh Hamed and Peter , to work uh in a in a first prototype ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a <disfmarker> f for the beginning of new project um <vocalsound> uh remote control for the design for a new remote control <vocalsound> .\n",
      "and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan ,\n",
      "Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design .\n",
      "<gap> and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day .\n",
      "Um , so <vocalsound> let's try the whiteboard <vocalsound> .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um so any of you who want to go .\n",
      "It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw .\n",
      "Let's talk about money .\n",
      "So . Twenty five Euro for a remote control .\n",
      "<vocalsound> On the international market .\n",
      "Yeah , we're to sell two million then .\n",
      "Mm <vocalsound> for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum .\n",
      "So any of you have experience in remote controls ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> So that could be a great um <vocalsound> application .\n",
      "Remote controls children proof .\n",
      "<vocalsound> but mainly it has to be very robust\n",
      "colourful , maybe <disfmarker>\n",
      "No , that's a good idea .\n",
      "Yeah even we can change colours , no ?\n",
      "like the phones and these things we c yeah .\n",
      "And it should be really <gap> small and <gap> .\n",
      "Small also ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> Should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control\n",
      "at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like <gap> .\n",
      "Uh maybe we can change the colours that <disfmarker> at least the frame .\n",
      "I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're <disfmarker> they never find a good button in the right place .\n",
      "Mm . So , some kind of idea uh with um um <vocalsound> cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what <disfmarker>\n",
      "no screens , it's too complex .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Too expensive for twelve Euro ?\n",
      "Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working .\n",
      "and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations .\n",
      "may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah .\n",
      "But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else .\n",
      "but for instance when you change channels you can have <disfmarker> you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five .\n",
      "But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put <disfmarker> yeah , you can only have one bit .\n",
      "And then back to the one I was before ,\n",
      "yeah , that would be cool .\n",
      "Go back button is good .\n",
      "Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes\n",
      "and uh I want you to mm <vocalsound> work on these ideas\n",
      "and try to make a uh <vocalsound> the ones , <vocalsound> make um <disfmarker> to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes .\n",
      "So what does M_E_ means ?\n",
      "Market Expert .\n",
      "Uh that's me .\n",
      "the user requirement specifications ,\n",
      "I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting .\n",
      "I will take the minutes\n",
      "you mm you three are going to do presentation .\n",
      "Um uh we want to know <disfmarker> to <disfmarker> at the end to know the new project's requirement\n",
      "we need uh to know the the user uh needs\n",
      "we want to know how it going to work\n",
      "third part <vocalsound> uh I don't remember <vocalsound>\n",
      "let's go for the three presentations ,\n",
      "so first um Marketing Expert .\n",
      "So as you know , you <disfmarker> I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo .\n",
      "I am the expert in marketing\n",
      "and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls ,\n",
      "what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls\n",
      "what they like ,\n",
      "what they don't like\n",
      "So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls\n",
      "what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls .\n",
      "First of all , they find it very ugly . <vocalsound>\n",
      "uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape ,\n",
      "I mean they're all the same ,\n",
      "Um what is interesting\n",
      "is that in fact it seems that they were <disfmarker> people are ready to pay for nice and look <disfmarker> and fancy looking uh remote control ,\n",
      "so I think we should probably spend lots of time in <disfmarker> and effort in that um .\n",
      "And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use\n",
      "and it it <disfmarker> the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls .\n",
      "For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often\n",
      "so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality\n",
      "And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used ,\n",
      "so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using .\n",
      "people are very frustrated w with their <vocalsound> remote controls\n",
      "and they for instance uh they don't even find it <vocalsound>\n",
      "it's <vocalsound> it's often lost somewhere in the in the <disfmarker> in your home\n",
      "Maybe if we have something where we could <vocalsound> ask the remote control please , where are you ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> Like uh something to to <disfmarker> like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality .\n",
      "And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls\n",
      "that nobody use ,\n",
      "so most of the the people say they they don't know how to <disfmarker> they <disfmarker> to use properly their r remote controls .\n",
      "And uh they are bad for R_S_I_\n",
      "but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ .\n",
      "Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect .\n",
      "but we have to take this into account .\n",
      "So we've listed a couple of uh\n",
      "Functions .\n",
      "that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls\n",
      "but what is important\n",
      "is to understand that the power button is not used often\n",
      "because in general you <vocalsound> use it only once per session ,\n",
      "but it is very relevant . <vocalsound>\n",
      "People want to have a power button .\n",
      "Channel selection is uh o often used <disfmarker> very often used\n",
      "now I remember what is R_S_I_ <vocalsound>\n",
      "it's repetitivity stress injury .\n",
      "Volume is not often used\n",
      "but people uh want to have control on volume\n",
      "And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings .\n",
      "All of them . they're not often used\n",
      "and they are s more or less relevant .\n",
      "It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant ,\n",
      "but seems that it's average relevant at least , so .\n",
      "I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext ,\n",
      "that it's out of date now because of internet .\n",
      "if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay\n",
      "One of the thing <disfmarker> the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility <disfmarker> the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control ,\n",
      "so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons\n",
      "but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want .\n",
      "So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control\n",
      "and as we can see it really depends on the age .\n",
      "Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant .\n",
      "And uh as the age goes up <vocalsound> the <vocalsound> the relevance goes down .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ?\n",
      "I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider .\n",
      "If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they <disfmarker> this should be\n",
      "so that's basically my findings .\n",
      "should we aim at the young people or not ?\n",
      "I think we should aim at the young people .\n",
      "But uh I think they are <disfmarker> they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device .\n",
      "In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people ,\n",
      "Then teletext is useless for them I think ,\n",
      "Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah .\n",
      "my name is Mark Dwight ,\n",
      "and um I am responsible for User Interface Design .\n",
      "However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design .\n",
      "that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this .\n",
      "And uh a general method which is <disfmarker> seems to be very useful for our task\n",
      "We should never complicate things too much .\n",
      "We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control .\n",
      "'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .\n",
      "So here is this remote control .\n",
      "It's quite a standard one ,\n",
      "but it's not from a T_V_ ,\n",
      "it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something .\n",
      "But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily .\n",
      "Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else ,\n",
      "compared to this one\n",
      "I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh <disfmarker> I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button .\n",
      "Maybe it can be yeah middle of <disfmarker> like , between those two\n",
      "Our question of the style , we should remember that our company\n",
      "puts fashion into electronics\n",
      "For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium .\n",
      "It is unbreakable\n",
      "and it is very universal .\n",
      "W we'll have a screen with a back light\n",
      "which can change colours ,\n",
      "and we can put all the options into this screen .\n",
      "We'll need only few buttons .\n",
      "All the other things can be controlled through the screen .\n",
      "And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click ,\n",
      "I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium\n",
      "We need power and volume .\n",
      "And let us include two nice features into this device ,\n",
      "first , power on and off can be made fully automatic .\n",
      "When you go to the sofa , take your control\n",
      "and point it to the T_V_ ,\n",
      "the T_V_ turns on .\n",
      "And when does it turn off ?\n",
      "When you don't touch the control\n",
      "For for enough time\n",
      "And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control .\n",
      "Suppose you set u you set up some volume\n",
      "and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room\n",
      "and take your control with you .\n",
      "Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes .\n",
      "According to your distance to <disfmarker> and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system .\n",
      "Uh I'm not sure about the screen ,\n",
      "wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ?\n",
      "Uh is it a touch screen by the way ?\n",
      "I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter .\n",
      "but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . <gap>\n",
      "So basically that's it .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_\n",
      "but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control .\n",
      "Can be easily done ,\n",
      "Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control\n",
      "I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment\n",
      "and then maybe m make it more generalised <disfmarker> yeah .\n",
      "but it's quite universal you know .\n",
      "We can just extend it to any device .\n",
      "for instance if I want to go to <disfmarker> directly to channel twenty five , how would I do <disfmarker> can I do that with this ?\n",
      "You know these days we have hundreds of channels ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> In fact I would propose another solution .\n",
      "Basically you use just four or five channels ,\n",
      "set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five ,\n",
      "and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel .\n",
      "But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display ,\n",
      "like you can uh de you can just button the number\n",
      "One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap .\n",
      "So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels ,\n",
      "on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah .\n",
      "Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next .\n",
      "But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers\n",
      "Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button\n",
      "and you can change mode <disfmarker> zapping mode or\n",
      "but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls\n",
      "so we can have more functions for T_V_\n",
      "uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .\n",
      "Could we carry out some research if we w really need this ,\n",
      "like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro .\n",
      "I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices\n",
      "<vocalsound> So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control .\n",
      "as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera .\n",
      "So we need to have some energy source to do what <disfmarker> to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . <vocalsound>\n",
      "so to do these functions we need an interface ,\n",
      "which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that .\n",
      "And then these messages <disfmarker> these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message\n",
      "and then it will process by the chip\n",
      "and then it will generate some information to the main device .\n",
      "uh since we are focusing on our interface device <gap> remote control\n",
      "mainly the energy source like the battery\n",
      "and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want ,\n",
      "we ought to have some kind of processor\n",
      "And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source\n",
      "Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations ,\n",
      "and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s ,\n",
      "To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh .\n",
      "because the people don't use one particular brand so\n",
      "So we need to check their specifications\n",
      "So we need to have particular encryption codes .\n",
      "so I'll input the connections to all this components .\n",
      "so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .\n",
      "Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you <disfmarker> can you make it on the whiteboard , or <disfmarker> mm .\n",
      "and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy ,\n",
      "we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip .\n",
      "and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip\n",
      "so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser\n",
      "you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah .\n",
      "Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them ,\n",
      "And what about the price of this component ?\n",
      "Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that ,\n",
      "because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like\n",
      "The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume\n",
      "or or it will be something like volume , up , down .\n",
      "so we try to only recognise those words\n",
      "and and because we can't really say user to say same wording\n",
      "And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight ,\n",
      "we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else\n",
      "it will be complicated\n",
      "First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons .\n",
      "actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this <gap> processor\n",
      "Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ?\n",
      "Like , if I want to put volume up I like do <disfmarker> mm I take my remote control do like <disfmarker> something like\n",
      "roll 'em up\n",
      "or roll 'em down .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Very expensive ,\n",
      "what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah .\n",
      "even automatic on off is also a bit problematic ,\n",
      "like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote\n",
      "and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off\n",
      "So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control .\n",
      "We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings .\n",
      "Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings ,\n",
      "so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I <disfmarker>\n",
      "we're now going to l have the lunch break .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work ,\n",
      "and um <vocalsound> we will uh meet again for the next meeting ,\n",
      "and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um <disfmarker> on the components\n",
      "you will focus on the component concept um\n",
      "uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept\n",
      "and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching .\n",
      "of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach .\n",
      "And we have um maybe we have to <disfmarker> we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ?\n",
      "Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .\n",
      "But speech recogniser can be possible .\n",
      "Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ?\n",
      "Like , you want to find it , you shout\n",
      "and it answers is I'm here ? Or <disfmarker>\n",
      "Just beeps ?\n",
      "But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .\n",
      "I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them\n",
      "because of the the frequency they they just answer to that .\n",
      "You can clap . Can you ?\n",
      "But it's a good feature I guess yeah\n",
      "we're done ?\n",
      "let's go to lunch .\n",
      "now we are on the conceptual design meeting .\n",
      "I will again do the secretary part\n",
      "uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy .\n",
      "Um um we have to take a decision on the control <disfmarker> remote control concepts\n",
      "and we have forty minutes .\n",
      "the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case .\n",
      "And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements .\n",
      "And at the end um Sammy will give um <vocalsound> a trend watching on what he's <disfmarker> he's been doing .\n",
      "we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface .\n",
      "For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities .\n",
      "First one , we can use simple battery ,\n",
      "or we can use <vocalsound> traditional solar cells\n",
      "mm and the material we can have plastic ,\n",
      "rubber which is good for this R_S_A_\n",
      "and then uh titanium , which can be <disfmarker> which have very good look\n",
      "an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display .\n",
      "we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control .\n",
      "this can be simple kind of programmable chip\n",
      "which can use microphone <gap> sensors .\n",
      "Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to <disfmarker> in our twelve Euros or around that .\n",
      "So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .\n",
      "we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells\n",
      "and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells\n",
      "And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or <disfmarker>\n",
      "the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .\n",
      "What is a double-curved shape ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> Like you can have two curves .\n",
      "we want to go for simple push buttons\n",
      "because it need a simple chip\n",
      "and it's really lesser <disfmarker> uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_\n",
      "uh which needs advanced chip technology\n",
      "and it's more expensive ,\n",
      "since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition\n",
      "we want to reduce uh cost .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .\n",
      "Uh <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> And also like in <disfmarker> if you put a <gap> it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things\n",
      "W we can use something like you know <vocalsound> the whole body's titanium\n",
      "but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts\n",
      "But full assembly <disfmarker> We'll use mainly for titanium <gap>\n",
      "and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh .\n",
      "<disfmarker> we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s\n",
      "Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology ,\n",
      "mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ?\n",
      "it's either L_C_D_ or push-button .\n",
      "maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design\n",
      "because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or <gap> or something\n",
      "so we want to reduce the cost on display\n",
      "it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information .\n",
      "the batteries uh are going to be very light .\n",
      "and now I think we have many options in the market\n",
      "so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries\n",
      "this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically ,\n",
      "instead of clapping why not just be <disfmarker> ask .\n",
      "We have dreams\n",
      "and the <disfmarker> in the end we find out that it's not feasible . <vocalsound>\n",
      "the concept of the interface .\n",
      "Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls .\n",
      "We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons\n",
      "and uh we got explanation for every button\n",
      "and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons\n",
      "and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here\n",
      "and uh go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons ,\n",
      "maybe this button is power on and off ?\n",
      "that's our concept .\n",
      "It's called the millennium remote control .\n",
      "<gap> doesn't make sense .\n",
      "This is very <vocalsound> ugly .\n",
      "too much concept .\n",
      "we will not use this . We will not use this .\n",
      "But instead of this I will devise <disfmarker> That's our concept .\n",
      "And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed .\n",
      "<gap> Do you think it can come in several colours ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours .\n",
      "Um but not the case .\n",
      "Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff ,\n",
      "Because apparently from your survey people like colours ,\n",
      "let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels .\n",
      "so that would be the option\n",
      "<vocalsound> But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ .\n",
      "Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler .\n",
      "if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly .\n",
      "you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we <disfmarker> if you want o more colours <vocalsound> on L_C_D_ ,\n",
      "there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um <vocalsound>\n",
      "'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are ,\n",
      "like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature ,\n",
      "but that's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah .\n",
      "Because uh I think there are two kinds of people .\n",
      "Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful\n",
      "and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that .\n",
      "It might be optional , yeah .\n",
      "Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ?\n",
      "That they can use it in darkness , like . Hand light ,\n",
      "And um the remote control's going to be smart\n",
      "but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ?\n",
      "I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done\n",
      "Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ?\n",
      "I just want to say it should be real smart .\n",
      "since we have <disfmarker> we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use <disfmarker>\n",
      "So it could be smart in that way .\n",
      "it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh <disfmarker> things like that\n",
      "that might be expensive\n",
      "<vocalsound> The remote that knows you . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I'm going to talk about trends\n",
      "and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control .\n",
      "Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know ,\n",
      "but uh basically there are <disfmarker> uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very <disfmarker> pay much attention to .\n",
      "The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel .\n",
      "And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy .\n",
      "Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative ,\n",
      "it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside\n",
      "and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing\n",
      "which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control .\n",
      "And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control\n",
      "but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . <vocalsound>\n",
      "currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of <vocalsound> of look or feel\n",
      "And I think of course uh <vocalsound> i it applies to everything .\n",
      "<vocalsound> It it can travel f from clothe to furniture <vocalsound> same idea .\n",
      "And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy ,\n",
      "When we were talking about rubber ,\n",
      "I think uh the rubber aspect might be important\n",
      "because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess .\n",
      "So maybe titanium it's not a good idea .\n",
      "Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy ,\n",
      "even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . I mean <disfmarker>\n",
      "And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like .\n",
      "these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ?\n",
      "we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course ,\n",
      "It's more general trend\n",
      "it's not particular to the remote control .\n",
      "But it seems that trends travel across things .\n",
      "but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid\n",
      "like they can't be really spongy\n",
      "We have to <disfmarker> I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables\n",
      "fruit . These things can be easily incorporated .\n",
      "We can have t colours or this shape\n",
      "If if it's something like rubber made or <disfmarker> I think it it's also going to be good .\n",
      "we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again .\n",
      "Um now you have to go straight on this individual action\n",
      "which i which are for Rama uh wil design ,\n",
      "um Mark the user interface design ,\n",
      "and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay .\n",
      "um and I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction .\n",
      "we want the speech recogniser\n",
      "and we want some kind of buttons\n",
      "and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables ,\n",
      "we want to follow general trend .\n",
      "<vocalsound> No , we don't have to ,\n",
      "Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend .\n",
      "are we confident enough on creating trends ?\n",
      "we can make it smell like fruit . <vocalsound>\n",
      "what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ?\n",
      "Or they really like <disfmarker> They more want these fancy features\n",
      "it has to be fancy\n",
      "so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us\n",
      "Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness .\n",
      "Do we take titanium smelling like fruit ,\n",
      "or do we make spongy uh fruity-like\n",
      "we will try to explore these two options\n",
      "Maybe you could explore the two option .\n",
      "Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean <gap> fruit-shaped .\n",
      "at least like we can make banana\n",
      "<vocalsound> Don't you say that you cannot do double shape <disfmarker> uh curved shape <disfmarker>\n",
      "Doub double-curved .\n",
      "and and s we're to see the <disfmarker> whether rubber is expensive\n",
      "In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the <disfmarker> like titanium panels on a whole rubber body .\n",
      "you explore now that you're going to work together these these two .\n",
      "Maybe we can have two different <gap> assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium .\n",
      "I think we have to choose .\n",
      "If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy\n",
      "still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or <disfmarker>\n",
      "Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information .\n",
      "The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says <disfmarker> if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .\n",
      "That's the converse to having zillions of button\n",
      "where each button does only one thing .\n",
      "and we just stick with two batteries\n",
      "so it's not any solar or <disfmarker>\n",
      "in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control .\n",
      "Because the trend goes faster than the life of the <disfmarker> <vocalsound>\n",
      "Yeah , we're done .\n",
      "Okay . So first , <vocalsound> let's uh see the prototype .\n",
      "And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this <vocalsound> jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . <vocalsound>\n",
      "So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .\n",
      "And we have speech recognition .\n",
      "Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise .\n",
      "And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Oh , these are strawberries . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> Material , we want to stick to titanium .\n",
      "So , we want to have <vocalsound> simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones .\n",
      "And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours .\n",
      "For the L_C_D_ .\n",
      "wh what are the strawberries for ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "That's location sensors .\n",
      "let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium . <vocalsound>\n",
      "so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven .\n",
      "One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is .\n",
      "what do you think , is it fancy ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "So here , two . Up .\n",
      "Then we have uh technology .\n",
      "d I think it's a one for that , at least .\n",
      "Robustness , uh-huh .\n",
      "It's um robust , yeah .\n",
      "Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ?\n",
      "The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial .\n",
      "And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this .\n",
      "It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ?\n",
      "we only address two main functions here\n",
      "and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So\n",
      "It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "Okay , two . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> So size and weight .\n",
      "Up to three for that ,\n",
      "Colour and shape .\n",
      "The case is silver titanium , no ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> And what about the strawberries on the top ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> I'm not convince .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year .\n",
      "We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too .\n",
      "So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours .\n",
      "Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and <disfmarker>\n",
      "I suggested three .\n",
      "And uh the last one is adaptive .\n",
      "Okay . <vocalsound> Let's go for one . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Now we have to do the average . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Two point one seven .\n",
      "So now , it has to fulfil the <vocalsound> financial criterium ?\n",
      "We need only one battery .\n",
      "We have sample chip .\n",
      "And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Yeah , I think we will go for a single curve ,\n",
      "Titanium .\n",
      "How many push-button ?\n",
      "Two .\n",
      "The scroll-wheel , okay .\n",
      "One L_C_D_ displayed .\n",
      "So we are at seventeen dot eight .\n",
      "Are we supposed to cut things out now ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> So think of what we can cut uh here . <vocalsound>\n",
      "if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_\n",
      "and the speaker .\n",
      "Apparently , we have to choose one or the other . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy .\n",
      "to make electricity .\n",
      "So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay ,\n",
      "We we win one .\n",
      "So , put minus one there , please . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> I'm not sure if this is legal .\n",
      "Okay , we're uh on target .\n",
      "Project evaluation , good . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Mm . See mm how <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Are we a good team ? Mm .\n",
      "Is there enough room for creativity ?\n",
      "Yeah , yeah .\n",
      "Team-work , very strong , I would say .\n",
      "I think white-board is useful .\n",
      "Digital pens , useful .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Ah , we got new idea , speech recognition , location finding . New materials , new s uh this fancy strawberry design .\n",
      "So , we are asked to to make uh uh a new remote control for television .\n",
      "And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly .\n",
      "So people can <gap> can use it without any any problem .\n",
      "Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh\n",
      "B did you send us an email about this ?\n",
      "Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ?\n",
      "Or you can put it in the shared folder .\n",
      "You get email , <gap> . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Yeah , from the account manager .\n",
      "I think it's for your guys to <vocalsound> how to design it all the aspects so you need that information .\n",
      "Yeah , so each of us has a role to do .\n",
      "We already have our role .\n",
      "So there are three kinds of designs , that's all .\n",
      "We have functional design , conceptual design , and detail design .\n",
      "So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ?\n",
      "I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we <disfmarker> in our mail we received from the account manager .\n",
      "I'm doing the interface .\n",
      "I'm doing the interface . <vocalsound>\n",
      "It was a little confusion about my uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Okay , I'll for industrial design .\n",
      "And and you <disfmarker> Norman ?\n",
      "Um working on i . <vocalsound> User interface . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Uh , I'm into marketing .\n",
      "A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface .\n",
      "See there's a role for everybody .\n",
      "Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done\n",
      "and what are your ideas about the <disfmarker>\n",
      "About the design or <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess .\n",
      "I mean working remotes we already have .\n",
      "This will be something different from the other remotes <disfmarker> remote controls .\n",
      "What we we have to keep in mind the <disfmarker> these characteristics .\n",
      "And of course it should not be very costly .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Well I I think that Norman and I would think about um the technical points\n",
      "and um we should discuss it in the next meeting , or\n",
      "What is the most important function aspect ?\n",
      "Yeah , it should be easy to work with .\n",
      "Uh . We <disfmarker> maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface .\n",
      "You just tell the television I want <disfmarker> which channel .\n",
      "Or or you can say for example , um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I want uh to list all the programme tonight .\n",
      "Just say maybe I just want to press <disfmarker> I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight .\n",
      "So instead of pressing the channel number , I am choosing the programmes directly .\n",
      "I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly .\n",
      "Like s uh you you you say we can use speech .\n",
      "The <vocalsound> the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it's more natural . Yeah .\n",
      "I mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand\n",
      "and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control .\n",
      "If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with <gap> trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog\n",
      "if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it .\n",
      "And I could talk to the T_V_ <disfmarker> television itself .\n",
      "But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um <vocalsound> there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme .\n",
      "Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea\n",
      "but I I think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to <disfmarker>\n",
      "because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs .\n",
      "We just want to retrieve the content\n",
      "so we can just use the service available .\n",
      "And then there's <disfmarker> there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven .\n",
      "The most there are only seven buttons .\n",
      "So I just choose the category one\n",
      "and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want ,\n",
      "Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the <disfmarker> Well channel programme or contents or <disfmarker> in an easy way , so <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , so you don't have to display here ,\n",
      "just display on the T_V_ screen , right ?\n",
      "and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f\n",
      "Because all the T_V_ uh the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons\n",
      "I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff\n",
      "Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board .\n",
      "And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of <disfmarker>\n",
      "So , I mean , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh <vocalsound> some dark scene , the lights adapt themself .\n",
      "The lighting in the room changes .\n",
      "Yeah , but we are designing just remote control .\n",
      "I mean , we have a option in the remote control .\n",
      "If we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote .\n",
      "Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there ,\n",
      "or you just want to put the function in ?\n",
      "the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . Right ?\n",
      "Uh , uh first one is to uh <vocalsound> buttons i or it could be anything with <gap> buttons . Uh to choose uh content s or channels .\n",
      "And uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents .\n",
      "so technically how <disfmarker> the problems that <disfmarker> how to do it is to <disfmarker> how to get the content .\n",
      "I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel\n",
      "I think that's the <gap> the things to do\n",
      "and uh to uh reflect about it\n",
      "and uh discuss it in the next meeting .\n",
      "we will get some information in the next meeting ,\n",
      "We will <gap> get information\n",
      "and then we'll come back in .\n",
      "So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ?\n",
      "And we'll discuss the other other aspects .\n",
      "Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one .\n",
      "And <gap> take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control .\n",
      "And we have <disfmarker> think I got a new project requirement .\n",
      "So I think uh teletext becomes outdated .\n",
      "So the popularity of the <disfmarker> since the popularity of the internet ,\n",
      "and I think we don't need lighting adaptive ,\n",
      "so the remote control should be only used for the the television .\n",
      "And of course we should have our image <gap> in the in the design .\n",
      "So , let's start with the the industrial designer .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Right , so um I will talk about the the w working design and <disfmarker>\n",
      "And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the <disfmarker> our new remote control for television .\n",
      "So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do .\n",
      "I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market\n",
      "and what what is the the cheapest possible <vocalsound> things we hav we can use .\n",
      "Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype\n",
      "And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that .\n",
      "And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that .\n",
      "So , wha what I think <vocalsound> for now <vocalsound> is <vocalsound> we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired\n",
      "so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the <gap> .\n",
      "Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication .\n",
      "And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication\n",
      "So uh this is the <vocalsound> the schema of the <vocalsound> o of the future uh remote controls\n",
      "so uh you can you can see the components , uh battery\n",
      "and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set .\n",
      "The one on top is for the um <disfmarker> well the functionali the functionalities\n",
      "One is a communication .\n",
      "and the the th red um <disfmarker> sorry the green one is is to <disfmarker> well , putting things together ,\n",
      "um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to <gap> uh to communicate with the T_V_ set .\n",
      "I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for <vocalsound> for the functionalities which is easy to to t\n",
      "What is F_P_G_A_ ?\n",
      "It's a field programmable gateway arrays .\n",
      "So why's it <disfmarker> how is it different from the Bluetooth ?\n",
      "Well , uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can <gap> pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want .\n",
      "And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices .\n",
      "So this are the <disfmarker> they have to work together ?\n",
      "Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well , th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send .\n",
      "Or it's something like <disfmarker> isn't hardware the first one ?\n",
      "And the second one is for the software .\n",
      "Okay , and how about the battery power ?\n",
      "Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ?\n",
      "I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the <disfmarker>\n",
      "And uh I I don't think it will need um <vocalsound> very uh much power to make it run , so <disfmarker>\n",
      "Mm . You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it .\n",
      "It's a good idea .\n",
      "Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always .\n",
      "People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out .\n",
      "We just make a small charger\n",
      "Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ?\n",
      "Also , but but <vocalsound> I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote <vocalsound> control .\n",
      "we do not want to make it P_D_A_ . <vocalsound>\n",
      "So I'm working on the technical functions design .\n",
      "So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have .\n",
      "So <vocalsound> so I found on a webs on the internet\n",
      "and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set .\n",
      "<vocalsound> For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on .\n",
      "So I found two very good prototypes for <vocalsound> for this interface from our competitors\n",
      "This are usual functionality <gap> .\n",
      "Ours is a bit uh different .\n",
      "So these are two example .\n",
      "One is from <vocalsound> <gap>\n",
      "the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah .\n",
      "This is the most competing prototypes I've found <vocalsound> .\n",
      "But then uh loo but then I found if you look at <disfmarker> you see on the left one there are too many buttons <disfmarker>\n",
      "And they are small <gap> .\n",
      "O on the right I tried to play with <vocalsound> the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number\n",
      "so it's very lousy .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So you <vocalsound> so you move to the next the next one .\n",
      "And then I I look at the user manual\n",
      "they are a hundred pages thick ,\n",
      "so we don't want that .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So I propose the easy to use uh prototype .\n",
      "You can navigate on T_V_ screen\n",
      "and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end <disfmarker> in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_\n",
      "and we need some <disfmarker> to do some preprocessing .\n",
      "From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the <vocalsound> on the remote controller , right ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> And then we <disfmarker> the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in <disfmarker> we may K_I_V_ .\n",
      "What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_\n",
      "Yeah , all the processing is done <disfmarker> the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the <disfmarker> <vocalsound>\n",
      "So we should have specific T_V_ ?\n",
      "We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> Yeah because <disfmarker> <vocalsound> are you just wondering what controller <disfmarker> okay .\n",
      "I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that\n",
      "and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because <disfmarker>\n",
      "So I come up with a simple design ,\n",
      "just keep the v navigation buttons . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Yes , that's a good idea , I think .\n",
      "We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to <disfmarker> i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well , f four five buttons , it's sufficient .\n",
      "It's easy to build ,\n",
      "it does not consume much power . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Oh , but you have a catch there ,\n",
      "um assume that um if you want to go to <disfmarker> if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then <vocalsound> .\n",
      "Well , then y you you go to the main menu\n",
      "and uh you have uh go to channel\n",
      "No , because you choose by channel ,\n",
      "so you don't have hundred channels to choose from .\n",
      "<gap> but uh I I think i i <gap> if you if you want to to make uh <disfmarker> well a a big jump <vocalsound> <gap> but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could <disfmarker>\n",
      "but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down ,\n",
      "well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or <disfmarker>\n",
      "we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that .\n",
      "Uh it's gonna be small .\n",
      "So it'll beep if you wanna find it\n",
      "too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . <vocalsound>\n",
      "you just uh shout <disfmarker> y h just <disfmarker>\n",
      "it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device .\n",
      "<gap> just <gap> give it a name and we call him .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And <gap> responds to you , and <gap> <vocalsound>\n",
      "Okay , after having the inputs from <vocalsound> industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here .\n",
      "And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines ,\n",
      "and the users send the feedbacks ,\n",
      "and based on that <disfmarker> These are the findings which we got\n",
      "and <disfmarker> yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote\n",
      "Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts\n",
      "But I think if you <gap> to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem .\n",
      "I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited <disfmarker> you have limited vocabulary <disfmarker>\n",
      "Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones .\n",
      "And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons\n",
      "<gap> it's not going to take much space also .\n",
      "It's going to be very slim .\n",
      "And next one was the size of the remote control .\n",
      "It has to be of course a very slim and small one .\n",
      "And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive ,\n",
      "I mean we have to look for a trade-off .\n",
      "The features and the cost .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I no <disfmarker> I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost .\n",
      "Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort ,\n",
      "Little bit more if it's with extra features .\n",
      "Yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think <disfmarker>\n",
      "I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes .\n",
      "but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast .\n",
      "And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages .\n",
      "we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well <disfmarker> yes a microphone into the the remote control , so <disfmarker>\n",
      "What about lighting adaptive options ?\n",
      "Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but <vocalsound> I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required .\n",
      "According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that .\n",
      "but it's quite possible\n",
      "but maybe not in this project .\n",
      "So any things to to discuss ?\n",
      "I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing .\n",
      "The speech interface\n",
      "and uh less uh reasonable uh cost .\n",
      "And the lighting adaptation\n",
      "and the teletext .\n",
      "And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions .\n",
      "If you are watching an foreign movie , you get <gap> subtitles sometimes .\n",
      "And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French .\n",
      "And if I am a German then I would like to have the <disfmarker> my options in German .\n",
      "So , the remote <disfmarker> it should have some <disfmarker> it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages .\n",
      "Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ?\n",
      "I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ?\n",
      "Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh <vocalsound> about a way to to access the internet via the television .\n",
      "Yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet .\n",
      "So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a <disfmarker> w which will c which will come in a few years .\n",
      "So you have to anticipate the the future ?\n",
      "well , not not to implement it ,\n",
      "but to <disfmarker> well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a <disfmarker> yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Yeah . Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital , right .\n",
      "Okay . So let's go for the the lunch break ,\n",
      "and we will meet after .\n",
      "So we come to the third meetings .\n",
      "Um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design\n",
      "and now we will talk about the conceptual design .\n",
      "So we will talk about some specific details .\n",
      "Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept\n",
      "the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department\n",
      "and have which components was uh available to build a remote control .\n",
      "So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique <vocalsound> to to store the energy .\n",
      "We also um <vocalsound> we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control .\n",
      "we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote .\n",
      "So uh it's a point to discuss .\n",
      "Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated ,\n",
      "but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And uh this is the last point , the choice of chips .\n",
      "So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy\n",
      "because I think solar energy wi won't work <vocalsound> in a cluttered uh <vocalsound> uh environment .\n",
      "For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice\n",
      "because it's trendy\n",
      "For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons , simple buttons\n",
      "What is this single curved <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote .\n",
      "You you will have the <disfmarker> well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the <disfmarker>\n",
      "It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat .\n",
      "And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ?\n",
      "Yeah the um that's the point .\n",
      "The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um <disfmarker>\n",
      "and by <disfmarker> well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy .\n",
      "But I d I don't know it's <disfmarker> if it is feasible\n",
      "because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy .\n",
      "We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product <vocalsound> ready for market . <vocalsound>\n",
      "we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh <vocalsound> if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy .\n",
      "So I um keep in touch with the R_ and D_ department .\n",
      "So the titanium case is the normal case that <disfmarker>\n",
      "I'll show you some pictures that I have\n",
      "and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not .\n",
      "'Cause I am not very sure , plastic , titanium or whatever .\n",
      "There's another point I want to make ,\n",
      "is that the uh <disfmarker> well you've seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some <disfmarker> why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can <vocalsound> use <disfmarker>\n",
      "So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system ,\n",
      "a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user\n",
      "and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data .\n",
      "we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here .\n",
      "The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on\n",
      "so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing .\n",
      "A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures .\n",
      "So the <disfmarker> here are some examples .\n",
      "So they cluster the buttons together .\n",
      "They group them into col they colour them\n",
      "and uh they have different forms as well .\n",
      "but this interface are kind of confusing .\n",
      "Uh basically there are too many buttons .\n",
      "So some people are propose voice recognition\n",
      "ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine <vocalsound> for this by a company\n",
      "when you tell the <disfmarker> you say good morning coffee machine\n",
      "and the machine are reply to you .\n",
      "And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used\n",
      "so we might consider that , supposedly .\n",
      "Mm so somebody <disfmarker> some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display\n",
      "so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen\n",
      "and then there you can u you can use that as buttons ,\n",
      "Touch screen , I mean .\n",
      "And some people propose a scroll button . Integrated with push buttons\n",
      "or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button .\n",
      "so there are a few aspects that I collected here .\n",
      "So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people ,\n",
      "basically they are programmable ,\n",
      "And then they also secure uh covers , to protect\n",
      "uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings .\n",
      "But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features .\n",
      "I'm just saying that the <disfmarker> currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f <gap> customisable for different people .\n",
      "And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover .\n",
      "Mm maybe useful for children ,\n",
      "And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside .\n",
      "So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside .\n",
      "this is another company that provides big buttons .\n",
      "I see that that is useful for old people\n",
      "But for our product we don't need a big one\n",
      "because you have voice recognition e eventually with use .\n",
      "<gap> We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ?\n",
      "but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control .\n",
      "And uh , this is another one\n",
      "the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume .\n",
      "So there's a up arrow and a down arrow .\n",
      "But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top <disfmarker>\n",
      "so it's confusing interface ,\n",
      "And here are <disfmarker> is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found .\n",
      "Big buttons are convenient ,\n",
      "voice recognition helps ,\n",
      "push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools .\n",
      "And uh user customisable is important\n",
      "and finally simplicity simplicity is the key .\n",
      "we have many concepts there\n",
      "but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used .\n",
      "Well I <vocalsound> I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities\n",
      "but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote\n",
      "since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that ,\n",
      "because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so .\n",
      "Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control <gap>\n",
      "and we should have just a button like help\n",
      "and you say uh and you ik you press the button help\n",
      "Yeah . That's a good idea .\n",
      "So you are display on the screen .\n",
      "On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote .\n",
      "So that eliminates all the complicated documentation <gap> ,\n",
      "But people are often enough looking at the help ,\n",
      "once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff .\n",
      "In the case where they need help , in the case where they need help .\n",
      "And let us see what the market demands .\n",
      "It's just for user customizable , for kids or old people .\n",
      "I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids\n",
      "Can be used by both kids and old people .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller , i <vocalsound> it could be a cube ,\n",
      "is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube\n",
      "and maybe you can just change the <vocalsound> um the buttons ,\n",
      "if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons ,\n",
      "you turn the other side you get the other buttons ,\n",
      "So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes\n",
      "and how it could be special from the other remotes .\n",
      "And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires .\n",
      "So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly ,\n",
      "they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything .\n",
      "And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy .\n",
      "And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user .\n",
      "And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot .\n",
      "And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons ,\n",
      "so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times .\n",
      "And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls .\n",
      "fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room\n",
      "And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it .\n",
      "fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes\n",
      "and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex .\n",
      "So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them .\n",
      "We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control .\n",
      "Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen .\n",
      "yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on\n",
      "I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy .\n",
      "So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it .\n",
      "It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control .\n",
      "Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have <vocalsound> a big screen in front of you , s\n",
      "You can use this screen instead of the big se screen ,\n",
      "If you re-use the existing screen , we element <disfmarker> eliminate the L_C_D_ ,\n",
      "and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy ,\n",
      "well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look\n",
      "on the speech recognition if the technology is available\n",
      "but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results .\n",
      "so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost\n",
      "<vocalsound> I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers . <vocalsound>\n",
      "And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls .\n",
      "And also the cost for the speech recognition .\n",
      "Ask our R_ and D_ department .\n",
      "Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary ,\n",
      "say eighty commands or so .\n",
      "And also the scroller button , how much will it cost . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button .\n",
      "<gap> from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button .\n",
      "Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or <vocalsound> help button .\n",
      "Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button\n",
      "so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality .\n",
      "It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important .\n",
      "But they are just less used compar\n",
      "But the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen\n",
      "and then you choose with the with the button to <disfmarker> well you navigate\n",
      "Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others .\n",
      "But if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen <vocalsound> I think that just five buttons are sufficient ,\n",
      "one to go up left right down and uh enter\n",
      "and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that .\n",
      "Or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television .\n",
      "Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background ,\n",
      "So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote , you just have a menu ,\n",
      "and this menu when you press the menu , in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff .\n",
      "And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_ . I <disfmarker>\n",
      "I think that there's no contradiction here ,\n",
      "because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more\n",
      "so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness\n",
      "and then you t turn <disfmarker> you just press lef increase or decrease button\n",
      "if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel ,\n",
      "so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_ ,\n",
      "And the third problem was to find the remote control .\n",
      "Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find\n",
      "You will listen to a peep , <vocalsound> special peep .\n",
      "that's exactly what I mean by voice commander .\n",
      "uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control ,\n",
      "so we have some one charger there\n",
      "and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger .\n",
      "And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is .\n",
      "And that's a good idea ,\n",
      "I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command ,\n",
      "because there are problems with a voice command .\n",
      "I mean charger would be fixed\n",
      "because it's always with electricity plugged .\n",
      "what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me .\n",
      "You never get it lost\n",
      "because uh every time you're off the computer <vocalsound> <disfmarker> the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where <disfmarker> to the charger .\n",
      "And of course the final point is a fancy look .\n",
      "As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy ,\n",
      "I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons .\n",
      "I mean <gap> uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and <vocalsound> use it , you can't avoid him .\n",
      "But you can have an button for child lock .\n",
      "So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even <gap> <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that .\n",
      "Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids\n",
      "I think these other four points they're the market demands\n",
      "and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think <disfmarker>\n",
      "So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on .\n",
      "Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these <gap> could be included .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser\n",
      "because uh if you want <gap> uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them .\n",
      "and you can say to your remote control like uh sports\n",
      "and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now\n",
      "we have a problem there .\n",
      "You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh <disfmarker> basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five\n",
      "and suddenly <vocalsound> the screen the channel goes to twenty five .\n",
      "So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent\n",
      "and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent .\n",
      "But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers .\n",
      "That will be too big .\n",
      "And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also .\n",
      "Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser .\n",
      "It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel .\n",
      "but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary .\n",
      "Als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number .\n",
      "Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary ,\n",
      "I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh <vocalsound> if <disfmarker> when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the <disfmarker> you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel ,\n",
      "you just use the control button uh ,\n",
      "you just you you just choose the the option you want\n",
      "Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel .\n",
      "Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train <disfmarker>\n",
      "if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_ <vocalsound>\n",
      "the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two .\n",
      "If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name <disfmarker> bad uh reputation for our company .\n",
      "So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands ,\n",
      "Or we can switch on or switch off the the special <gap> , yeah .\n",
      "well I think that's a good uh a good option\n",
      "because it's simple and uh simple to implement also , so .\n",
      "I think these are the practical problems .\n",
      "So we need to take care of them in the design .\n",
      "Maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting .\n",
      "It's time to close this meeting .\n",
      "So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design\n",
      "and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control .\n",
      "So let's see the <disfmarker> what did you prepare .\n",
      "S so so I discussed with Guillaume .\n",
      "and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes ,\n",
      "because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive .\n",
      "One with and one without L_C_D_s .\n",
      "Um but both comes with a charger\n",
      "and then detachable and uh or <gap> control module .\n",
      "And detachable big buttons for all people um .\n",
      "<vocalsound> S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes <vocalsound> .\n",
      "Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display .\n",
      "And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button .\n",
      "You can uh choose the direction\n",
      "You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the <vocalsound> for the speech recognition system here .\n",
      "And here the the switch that control if you want <disfmarker>\n",
      "The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere .\n",
      "Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ?\n",
      "Well so it's a microphone array .\n",
      "Oh it's very costly , microphone array <vocalsound> .\n",
      "it's just a single microphone ,\n",
      "I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to <disfmarker>\n",
      "well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance .\n",
      "And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off .\n",
      "And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger .\n",
      "How much does it cost this one ?\n",
      "Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars\n",
      "Ah it's above it's above the budget .\n",
      "but uh it's just a prototype\n",
      "the <gap> and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars . <gap>\n",
      "How many b battery is there ?\n",
      "Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it .\n",
      "A_A_ rechargeable batteries .\n",
      "Is that two or one ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> Actually uh it's a flexible thing .\n",
      "So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger\n",
      "and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright .\n",
      "I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there ,\n",
      "This button is like the mouse <disfmarker> is like a joystick ,\n",
      "you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction\n",
      "and it <disfmarker> the additi functions associated to all the actions\n",
      "you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button <vocalsound> .\n",
      "You can move up , down , left , right ,\n",
      "or you can do a swing .\n",
      "Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ .\n",
      "So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration .\n",
      "The second version is also simpler ,\n",
      "we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also <vocalsound> .\n",
      "Uh-huh and also the switch .\n",
      "Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before .\n",
      "But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation .\n",
      "Press one button uh acting as a a enter button .\n",
      "So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user .\n",
      "And uh it's also cheaper to produce .\n",
      "We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . <vocalsound>\n",
      "And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger ,\n",
      "and if you disable speech recognition system then ?\n",
      "W w I'll I'll come to that point later on .\n",
      "in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah .\n",
      "It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone\n",
      "but uh again depends on the types .\n",
      "I think we have to investigate more on that , but <vocalsound> <disfmarker>\n",
      "The price should be below twelve and a half Euro .\n",
      "but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to <disfmarker> people are willing to pay more for good design .\n",
      "but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment .\n",
      "The price of selling is twenty five Euros .\n",
      "the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular\n",
      "so you want more function you pay more .\n",
      "If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system ,\n",
      "Something like customised . Yeah\n",
      "for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it <disfmarker> put it back in , or you can use the other one ,\n",
      "or <vocalsound> the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah .\n",
      "You want a microphone to put in the <vocalsound> speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see <vocalsound> .\n",
      "It's pretty flexible in the yeah price <vocalsound> .\n",
      "You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control\n",
      "that that you ca you can add up <vocalsound> to the <disfmarker> to your remote control\n",
      "i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on .\n",
      "H here is just the the the module for the kids\n",
      "and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up <disfmarker> they come up with their modules ,\n",
      "We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled ,\n",
      "and it acts like the previous one ,\n",
      "you just plug in and it works .\n",
      "the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful .\n",
      "Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons ,\n",
      "powerful is that all the controls with <vocalsound> the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n\n",
      "that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here <vocalsound> .\n",
      "Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you .\n",
      "The first one is the speech recogniser ,\n",
      "again it's detachable or add-on .\n",
      "And then we also have security feature\n",
      "it's very robust <gap> ,\n",
      "and the material , what's the material again ?\n",
      "The titanium\n",
      "Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one ,\n",
      "again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want .\n",
      "Lithium-ion may be a good one ,\n",
      "again you pay for what you get ,\n",
      "and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder .\n",
      "So when you finish watching your T_V_ <vocalsound> and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger ,\n",
      "And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary ,\n",
      "so we didn't define the vocabulary\n",
      "so it's up to the user to define\n",
      "And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a <gap> of T_V_ programmes by genre ,\n",
      "and this can be used by the adult or by the children .\n",
      "What's the price to p to produce ?\n",
      "Well so the price to produce <disfmarker> For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device .\n",
      "The <disfmarker> without without the charger\n",
      "it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems .\n",
      "Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules ,\n",
      "and finally three dollars for the charger .\n",
      "So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the L_C_D_ <vocalsound> , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two .\n",
      "We don't have all the options <vocalsound> .\n",
      "so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars .\n",
      "it's below the the the budget .\n",
      "I think we will just have a rough look\n",
      "and then we can make our statements ,\n",
      "and we can finalise the product based on this discu\n",
      "So the marketing made an evaluation criteria\n",
      "and these were some of the findings ,\n",
      "and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface ,\n",
      "but most of the people what they are interested is <disfmarker> first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel ,\n",
      "it should be very fancy with colourful\n",
      "and uh very handy to hold .\n",
      "And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative .\n",
      "Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative .\n",
      "And the third one is easy to use .\n",
      "Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself\n",
      "since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons .\n",
      "here you can find <disfmarker> these are the latest fashion updates ,\n",
      "and so this <disfmarker> in Paris and Milan <gap> they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable ,\n",
      "so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like .\n",
      "So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes .\n",
      "And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium ,\n",
      "it should be somewhat spongy .\n",
      "you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy <vocalsound> .\n",
      "Yeah so uh <vocalsound> so finally we have these three criterias .\n",
      "One is fancy look ,\n",
      "second is innovative ,\n",
      "and third is easy to use .\n",
      "So <disfmarker> and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these ,\n",
      "say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven ,\n",
      "and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this .\n",
      "So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ,\n",
      "so on this scale , if it is true , if it is <disfmarker> if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one ,\n",
      "or if it is false , it doesn't <disfmarker> it looks uh <disfmarker> it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven .\n",
      "But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ?\n",
      "according to you designers ,\n",
      "On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look <disfmarker> how does it look ?\n",
      "D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ?\n",
      "I'll I'll say three or four .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think we can improve on the design .\n",
      "Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh <gap> <vocalsound> design .\n",
      "Um we have been focused all all this <vocalsound> time on the <vocalsound> on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity .\n",
      "So I take three on <disfmarker> with L_C_D_ ?\n",
      "So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ?\n",
      "Uh four .\n",
      "I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated\n",
      "so removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look .\n",
      "And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ .\n",
      "Well it's it's the same for both\n",
      "so <vocalsound> I will give a five , six . <vocalsound>\n",
      "from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um <vocalsound> the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content ,\n",
      "and for now <disfmarker> and another innovation we have is simplicity\n",
      "and <disfmarker> simplicity , few buttons , we've uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> A lot of functionalities .\n",
      "So without L_C_D_ ?\n",
      "Mm for both it's the the same innovations .\n",
      "So maybe I can put six to seven .\n",
      "actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts .\n",
      "then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness .\n",
      "Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ?\n",
      "We haven't really uh determined <vocalsound> what are <disfmarker> actually actually\n",
      "I mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme .\n",
      "but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen .\n",
      "on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now .\n",
      "If you have the L_C_D_ ,\n",
      "Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ .\n",
      "But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ .\n",
      "Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ <vocalsound> we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ ,\n",
      "So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ?\n",
      "Well I think both are really easy to use\n",
      "and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so <disfmarker>\n",
      "so I will give a six for the easy to use .\n",
      "No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ .\n",
      "Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price ,\n",
      "So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes\n",
      "according to fruit and vegetable\n",
      "or a spongy touch\n",
      "without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition .\n",
      "I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect .\n",
      "I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people .\n",
      "For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated\n",
      "because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons .\n",
      "For kids they want simply the <gap> s similarit for the old people they want simplicity ,\n",
      "but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um <disfmarker> we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people .\n",
      "So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ?\n",
      "Um six .\n",
      "S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ .\n",
      "As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also ,\n",
      "and it's going to be much simpler to use .\n",
      "so let's go back to our laboratory and <vocalsound> <disfmarker>\n",
      "<vocalsound> To improve on the design .\n",
      "<gap> what about the integration of speech recognition ?\n",
      "The speech recogniser is a add-on module .\n",
      "That's going to be an optional .\n",
      "I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control ,\n",
      "because maybe parents will lose these uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module\n",
      "Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children\n",
      "<disfmarker> <vocalsound> when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people ,\n",
      "and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them .\n",
      "So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional <disfmarker> uh will be optional .\n",
      "<vocalsound> But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "I think it inc increase . <vocalsound>\n",
      "because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but <disfmarker>\n",
      "it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the <vocalsound> functionalities um on the same module , but uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well well the other aspect is that if <vocalsound> in the <disfmarker> when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the <disfmarker> you're gonna keep the same customer ,\n",
      "because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons .\n",
      "i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future .\n",
      "attracting them to come back in again and again .\n",
      "Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be <disfmarker> can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ?\n",
      "And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ?\n",
      "Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ?\n",
      "but we are also the um well the components will have to change\n",
      "because uh we have to deal with the shape\n",
      "Or uh it could be like this <disfmarker> the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all .\n",
      "What we can change is to propose the <vocalsound> customers with skins .\n",
      "For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin\n",
      "and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better .\n",
      "we can have the same global shape\n",
      "and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that .\n",
      "I think you need to look into the material .\n",
      "I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models .\n",
      "Project evaluation project satisfaction , for example .\n",
      "I don't know , we have to ask these question .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Room for creativity .\n",
      "This room is a bit small , but <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> but I think it's okay for us to work with . <vocalsound>\n",
      "This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations .\n",
      "And the leadership was excellent .\n",
      "Yeah I think so <vocalsound> .\n",
      "Uh the teamwork was very very good .\n",
      "And new ideas found .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Come up with new product <vocalsound> .\n",
      "Yeah and also more well uh <vocalsound> more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting\n",
      "uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that ,\n",
      "We achieved uh project goal I think .\n",
      "that is within the budget .\n",
      "yes , more or less .\n",
      "Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple .\n",
      "Yeah thank you for your work and <disfmarker>\n",
      "I'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting .\n",
      "Um I'm the Project Manager of this project ,\n",
      "This is uh the agenda for our first meeting .\n",
      "I will hope we will get acquainted to each other .\n",
      "We'll do a little tool training with these two things .\n",
      "We'll take a look at the project plan .\n",
      "Uh there will be time for discussion .\n",
      "Um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table .\n",
      "Um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field\n",
      "so the little cameras can see your face .\n",
      "and there are microphones here also .\n",
      "and uh I'd like to hear uh who you are and what your functions are uh on this project .\n",
      "and my uh function is User Interface Design , I think .\n",
      "uh I'm the Industrial Designer\n",
      "I'm uh <vocalsound> Marketing Expert .\n",
      "<vocalsound> My job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers .\n",
      "I said uh we're working on a project\n",
      "and the aim for the project is to to create a <disfmarker> to design a new remote control\n",
      "which uh has to be original , trendy and of course , user friendly .\n",
      "It consists of three phases , namely the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design .\n",
      "As you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and a meeting\n",
      "But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here .\n",
      "They are smart boards .\n",
      "As you can see , you can give a presentation on them .\n",
      "And uh this one here is a white board .\n",
      "Um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder\n",
      "and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room .\n",
      "As you can see , this is the same tool bar uh as is located here .\n",
      "Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page ,\n",
      "um uh to go back and forward between pages ,\n",
      "Um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , for instance\n",
      "Um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want .\n",
      "it's not such a fast board ,\n",
      "and of course you can also , when you click here , uh erase things ,\n",
      "And um you can also delete an entire page ,\n",
      "but we ask you not to do that .\n",
      "because we want to save all the results .\n",
      "And you can also um let's see I think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen ,\n",
      "Um that's what you will need for our first exercise ,\n",
      "because I'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal .\n",
      "to do it on a blank sheet ,\n",
      "with different colours\n",
      "and also with different pen widths\n",
      "Um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word .\n",
      "Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing , eh . <vocalsound>\n",
      "it could be a turtle , or a snail ,\n",
      "It's a giraffe .\n",
      "<vocalsound> it can reach everything .\n",
      "And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project .\n",
      "Could you write the words , uh underneath it ?\n",
      "I've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence .\n",
      "You can try out the eraser now . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Um from the finance department I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five Euros .\n",
      "And we're hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros\n",
      "and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market .\n",
      "And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max .\n",
      "it's time uh for some discussion .\n",
      "What's your experience with remote control ?\n",
      "I always lose them .\n",
      "A lot of buttons which you don't use\n",
      "Not user friendly .\n",
      "Black , all black .\n",
      "maybe we should try to make it fun .\n",
      "You had different remote controls for different devices .\n",
      "perhaps you can integrate them or something .\n",
      "but then again you you still have a lot of buttons ,\n",
      "there's a possibility to g uh to uh to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection\n",
      "but um <vocalsound> the usual buttons such as uh um <vocalsound> zapping uh as you call it in Dutch . Uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly .\n",
      "maybe a a minimalist design , the least uh possible amount uh of buttons .\n",
      "But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it .\n",
      "Because uh things for uh teletext , I dunno uh , <vocalsound> w\n",
      "you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons ,\n",
      "but on the other hand they need many buttons\n",
      "Because I think a market will be all kind of people . Elderly p el elderly , young people , so .\n",
      "I think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and Britain , yeah .\n",
      "I think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control , they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television .\n",
      "but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference <disfmarker> different televisions sets on one remote control . It's impossible .\n",
      "Because uh for example Sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for <disfmarker> to see on one side of the screen uh teletext , and on the other side uh just n uh regular television . Uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Because you can't use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television .\n",
      "always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code .\n",
      "Um our next meeting uh will start <disfmarker> well we're a little bit early , but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes .\n",
      "In the meantime uh there's time for some uh individual actions .\n",
      "meeting will close in five minutes . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Um the Marketing Expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification .\n",
      "The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design .\n",
      "the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design ,\n",
      "Um and of course specific instructions uh will be sent to you uh through your personal coach .\n",
      "I think then we have to head uh back to our offices and uh start working .\n",
      "Where does it says we have to make a remote ,\n",
      "I expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive uh shortly .\n",
      "see you all in about thirty minutes , then .\n",
      "Um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting .\n",
      "I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary ,\n",
      "which means I will make uh minutes\n",
      "Um if I'm right , there are three presentations ,\n",
      "And um we will also take a look at new project requirements , um if you haven't heard about them yet .\n",
      "Um well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation .\n",
      "I'll go first . Okay . I'll go first yeah .\n",
      "I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control .\n",
      "Uh when you press a button , <vocalsound> uh that's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume , um a little connection is made\n",
      "on a little print plate\n",
      "Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal\n",
      "which uh then is si uh signalled <vocalsound> to uh several transistors\n",
      "And that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal\n",
      "which is sent to the television set .\n",
      "Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls , are that uh they are very easy to produce ,\n",
      "uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production\n",
      "Uh and the technology's already available ,\n",
      "Uh I made a little uh uh animation of <vocalsound> about how a tran our uh remote controller works .\n",
      "the sub-component , I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it's the button .\n",
      "Uh when it is pressed down , um , the switch is ter is uh is switched on ,\n",
      "so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course ,\n",
      "Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control .\n",
      "Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held ,\n",
      "Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons .\n",
      "Perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons\n",
      "because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged ,\n",
      "uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore .\n",
      "And uh well as I said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs . <vocalsound>\n",
      "and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote .\n",
      "Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found .\n",
      "Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set ,\n",
      "adjust volume , that kind of thing .\n",
      "There are some uh examples of remote controls .\n",
      "You can see they are very different .\n",
      "The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera .\n",
      "And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach ,\n",
      "A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that .\n",
      "personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use .\n",
      "And then uh make it <disfmarker> I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance .\n",
      "If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo ,\n",
      "you could reuse the buttons\n",
      "And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much .\n",
      "<vocalsound> We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote ,\n",
      "that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control ,\n",
      "The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more .\n",
      "Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera .\n",
      "And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age .\n",
      "The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features ,\n",
      "and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area .\n",
      "Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often .\n",
      "So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly ,\n",
      "and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot ,\n",
      "so the buttons sh should be that small ,\n",
      "or shouldn't be that complex\n",
      "Remote control has to have to have a low power usage ,\n",
      "because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour ,\n",
      "The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control ,\n",
      "so those <disfmarker> they <disfmarker> those have to h be find very easily .\n",
      "Buttons . Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized .\n",
      "or in L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options .\n",
      "but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot .\n",
      "So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use .\n",
      "The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features .\n",
      "Because they use the remote control often more often ,\n",
      "and are more technical than the ol older people .\n",
      "And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control .\n",
      "So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot <disfmarker> not that much on the younger pep younger people ,\n",
      "but also somewhat on the elderly people .\n",
      "but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use\n",
      "And it should be easy to use . Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements ?\n",
      "then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them\n",
      "Um teletext does <disfmarker> has become outdated since the popularity of the internet .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext .\n",
      "Uh the remote control should only be used for the television ,\n",
      "otherwise the project becomes more complex ,\n",
      "Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus ,\n",
      "and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty ,\n",
      "And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products ,\n",
      "which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design .\n",
      "according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions .\n",
      "you said it should only uh work with one appliance ?\n",
      "Yeah . Only be used for television .\n",
      "Then it should have uh on , off ,\n",
      "Standby options ,\n",
      "the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it ,\n",
      "A button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers .\n",
      "I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that ,\n",
      "because some T_V_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve ,\n",
      "and that's that's not relaxed\n",
      "But uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get\n",
      "new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty ,\n",
      "Uh younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap .\n",
      "A touch screen uh probably uh even more .\n",
      "perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "you don't know how much it costs , the L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "I don't have any costs here ,\n",
      "But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ?\n",
      "for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen\n",
      "and it's possible to p uh press them down , just like a touch screen .\n",
      "we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ?\n",
      "I think it's the most easier thing ,\n",
      "But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people ,\n",
      "but also on the older ,\n",
      "and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ?\n",
      "But our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty .\n",
      "but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger .\n",
      "if it costs <disfmarker> gets too much , too expensive , then yeah , we should be sticking to rubber buttons .\n",
      "I think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of L_C_D_ uh screens .\n",
      "if you uh you receive an email about that , uh can you post it in the <disfmarker>\n",
      "But for now it's L_C_D_ . Okay .\n",
      "it'll look fancy with L_C_D_ screen . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound>\n",
      "They think it's ugly . When it has an L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it .\n",
      "what else does our remote need ?\n",
      "A mute button .\n",
      "<vocalsound> The most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection , volume con selection ,\n",
      "and power s power usage .\n",
      "And a teletext , but that is not of the question .\n",
      "But shouldn't you put a button of <disfmarker> for teletext on the <disfmarker> for the people who want to use it ?\n",
      "and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext .\n",
      "And other other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings ,\n",
      "they are less important ,\n",
      "but I think they should be there ,\n",
      "but in a sub sub-menu or something like that .\n",
      "Uh I think it's also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in English , uh , to not use batteries ,\n",
      "power supply is one of the most important things .\n",
      "Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off .\n",
      "If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno .\n",
      "because I don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it ,\n",
      "so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down , the remote shuts down .\n",
      "And go to standby mode when you don't use it ,\n",
      "And maybe a low battery indicator ? On the screen .\n",
      "of put it in a recharger . Charger .\n",
      "So we are going for the for the recharger .\n",
      "I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days ,\n",
      "uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television ,\n",
      "that's also a a a great advantage\n",
      "because you can't lose it anymore .\n",
      "<vocalsound> But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch\n",
      "because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_ .\n",
      "just a cable , or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on . Something like that ,\n",
      "Functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen ,\n",
      "so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points\n",
      "I think that this should be standard . Large button <disfmarker> large buttons .\n",
      "And you said something about speech recognition ?\n",
      "twelve fifty , twelve fifty . <vocalsound>\n",
      "also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent .\n",
      "I know let's do a speech . <vocalsound>\n",
      "But they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think an L_C_D_ screen <vocalsound> should be suf sufficient .\n",
      "But when you look at the percentages <disfmarker>\n",
      "but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh .\n",
      "I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen ,\n",
      "But would it be useful to imple implement both ?\n",
      "Yeah , if the costs al allow it . <vocalsound>\n",
      "but how would you like to implement that ,\n",
      "that you say volume up , and then it goes up ,\n",
      "Certain systems already exist , I think .\n",
      "Then you also have to have different languages if we go international .\n",
      "But that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "you can use icons\n",
      "it should be done . If it could be done , should be done .\n",
      "so we only do this when we have enough money left .\n",
      "I've written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , uh the digits from one to zero , huh . Um <disfmarker> or from zero to nine . Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator .\n",
      "And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons\n",
      "You also now have colours .\n",
      "Curved ?\n",
      "we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub-menus .\n",
      "so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu ,\n",
      "Aren't we forgetting something very important ?\n",
      "We could check the other remote controls with technical functions .\n",
      "wide screen , high screen , different things you have ,\n",
      "it should be available , but then in separate screen settings or something .\n",
      "Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote , an expanded version .\n",
      "and the buttons , should they have colours ?\n",
      "Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "Perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones <vocalsound> .\n",
      "make it available in different colours , you mean ?\n",
      "signal for las final five minutes .\n",
      "Channel settings .\n",
      "we're having a a general menu with the most used functions , uh teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings ,\n",
      "Or do we have any buttons ? On the remote .\n",
      "you only have channel button or volume button .\n",
      "But that's also in the L_C_D_ ,\n",
      "So we don't have any normal buttons\n",
      "Maybe only the on and o on and off button .\n",
      "But isn't idea to use uh uh what you said , uh normal on and off button for the T_V_ ,\n",
      "But a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ ,\n",
      "maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ ,\n",
      "There has to be a on button on the remote ,\n",
      "No\n",
      "you just tap I think .\n",
      "because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on .\n",
      "I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button ,\n",
      "But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on ,\n",
      "I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control .\n",
      "So actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote . No buttons at all .\n",
      "that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote .\n",
      "postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting ,\n",
      "for now , we're having a lunch break ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work .\n",
      "I will uh write uh minutes , if I can create them out of this .\n",
      "And uh put them in the the project documents uh folder .\n",
      "And here are the individual actions for the for the other roles .\n",
      "And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach .\n",
      "welcome everyone to our next meeting .\n",
      "but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda\n",
      "I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side .\n",
      "Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened .\n",
      "Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes\n",
      "Um today we once again have uh three presentations , if I'm right ,\n",
      "and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts .\n",
      "I'd say let's start with the first presentation .\n",
      "Um in the same order as last time ?\n",
      "Components design ,\n",
      "first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um <vocalsound> you know from what uh the remote control's formed .\n",
      "Uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control .\n",
      "the case was is made from rubber , I suppose .\n",
      "because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control\n",
      "the uh titanium was also an option .\n",
      "But uh it's a very expensive material .\n",
      "Uh rubber is , I think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh\n",
      "Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber .\n",
      "Uh titanium uh you have to paint it\n",
      "and with that uh it's possible to scratch it\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> I h I had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved .\n",
      "it's t two dimensional .\n",
      "I think it's uh it's best to draw\n",
      "I thought of an idea like this .\n",
      "So it also looks nice when it's on your table .\n",
      "uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table ,\n",
      "but it's c it's stands .\n",
      "Um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already .\n",
      "Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen ,\n",
      "And um it should be made of strong plastic\n",
      "and it should be bright .\n",
      "uh this should uh be uh our uh button component .\n",
      "Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already ,\n",
      "uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station\n",
      "And they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use .\n",
      "Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip\n",
      "but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it\n",
      "with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition\n",
      "there should be some more uh investigation on that side .\n",
      "I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours .\n",
      "I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber .\n",
      "but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour . <vocalsound>\n",
      "We could make a little R_ and R_ <gap> on the top of the machine .\n",
      "I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls\n",
      "Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely\n",
      "but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium .\n",
      "I thought a little bit about the interface . Uh how it should look .\n",
      "And uh <vocalsound> uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen ,\n",
      "Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition .\n",
      "And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device\n",
      "and it answers you .\n",
      "And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker .\n",
      "This uh and there's an easy way to uh program that\n",
      "Um perhaps it's useful ,\n",
      "perhaps for because people um lose the remote ,\n",
      "they can yell uh remote where are you and <gap> calls or something .\n",
      "And perhaps we could uh implement that .\n",
      "And then I have to go out of the presentation\n",
      "because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like\n",
      "I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw <gap> .\n",
      "I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume .\n",
      "and then the buttons above and uh below\n",
      "the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon .\n",
      "I think it's not really on scale and and so forth .\n",
      "Um an options button .\n",
      "It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing .\n",
      "Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should ,\n",
      "so that it's better in your hand or something uh .\n",
      "But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that .\n",
      "Uh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do\n",
      "And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings .\n",
      "And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote ,\n",
      "so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things .\n",
      "I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff .\n",
      "The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy .\n",
      "The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative ,\n",
      "like the L_C_D_ screen that's <vocalsound> quite innovative\n",
      "And the third thing is it should be easy to use .\n",
      "I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use .\n",
      "The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff .\n",
      "The round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber .\n",
      "It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things .\n",
      "Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff .\n",
      "They liked square shapes with round edges .\n",
      "And hard materials like wood , um titanium .\n",
      "And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like\n",
      "It's it's a bit like a banana .\n",
      "And for the elderly people just plain old .\n",
      "Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs ,\n",
      "or was it two colours ?\n",
      "We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes .\n",
      "I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares .\n",
      "You could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea .\n",
      "I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh\n",
      "Changing just the shape of the uh remote control ?\n",
      "Perhaps you could find something in the middle .\n",
      "round corners , but s but square , yeah .\n",
      "But maybe then both groups won't buy it .\n",
      "So it's a bit square , but it's also a bit uh round .\n",
      "Uh <disfmarker> Look something like that <gap> . Autumn colours like red , brown .\n",
      "So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour .\n",
      "between the young people ? Fresh , exciting .\n",
      "And the old people , old and boring .\n",
      "like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones\n",
      "So we have to decide if we're going to use\n",
      "real hard rubber , or soft rubber . Or something something between that .\n",
      "Soft rubber .\n",
      "like like like a a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in ,\n",
      "Yeah it's quite hard\n",
      "but you can press it in .\n",
      "So we should first decide about shape , I think .\n",
      "and the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small . Um .\n",
      "w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like <disfmarker>\n",
      "but I think it should be larger .\n",
      "Yeah , three quarters .\n",
      "Larger I think .\n",
      "Looks a bit like a Game Boy now . <vocalsound>\n",
      "but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll <vocalsound> you'll always get some <disfmarker>\n",
      "You always touch it ,\n",
      "because you have how much ? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen .\n",
      "Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time .\n",
      "And we won't include a a pen , or something to point ,\n",
      "we we want to do it with our fingers ,\n",
      "Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah o yeah <gap> , if they think it's handy to use a pen .\n",
      "And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh . <vocalsound>\n",
      "but that that can be <gap> with plain soft tissue .\n",
      "maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision .\n",
      "So we can discuss these points .\n",
      "<gap> those points um energy question mark .\n",
      "are we going to do it with separate docking station\n",
      "Uh chip on print and case .\n",
      "I think energy were batteries\n",
      "The docking station .\n",
      "Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries\n",
      "We already decided that on the previous meeting .\n",
      "which you can recharge through the docking station .\n",
      "if the badg the batteries are dead\n",
      "then you can re you can uh change them .\n",
      "<vocalsound> but it should be th I think normal batteries ,\n",
      "normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah .\n",
      "Um what was with the chip on print ?\n",
      "Chip on print with a with a <vocalsound> simple uh a sim not a simple but a <disfmarker>\n",
      "but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ?\n",
      "You still have a print plate .\n",
      "I dunno what w what we have to decide about that .\n",
      "chip on print , I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got , uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button .\n",
      "But when you got a L_C_D_ screen , with no uh with not <vocalsound> <disfmarker> the buttons are not always on the same place ,\n",
      "but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate ,\n",
      "you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess .\n",
      "Mm , I don't I dunno I don't think that's <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ .\n",
      "but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume .\n",
      "So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_\n",
      "Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "And the case , yeah we already discussed the case ,\n",
      "we wanted to make it from rubber\n",
      "but but a hard rubber like this ?\n",
      "Or softer rubber\n",
      "Uh hard rubber I think .\n",
      "We have different colours .\n",
      "the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ?\n",
      "I think it's more round than square . <vocalsound>\n",
      "But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps .\n",
      "I think it meets more the young people than the older people .\n",
      "But that's what we want , <gap> .\n",
      "and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ?\n",
      "I thought that was a quite good\n",
      "Uh got a single curved uh rubber\n",
      "you c you can draw it on your paper\n",
      "And load it on the the user the server .\n",
      "there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think\n",
      "what we should also have on , I just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh\n",
      "<gap> if if you touch options , you can't go back to this uh right away now .\n",
      "Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ?\n",
      "If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter .\n",
      "I think it's it's easier to have it something like <disfmarker> Oh a button uh minus here , plus over here . A minus here , plus over here .\n",
      "The other buttons and on here <vocalsound> the top .\n",
      "I think I would put a plus and a min uh here .\n",
      "And then the P_ in the mid in the middle\n",
      "We'll leave that to the usability engineering then . <vocalsound>\n",
      "But I'm going to look if I've got some examples\n",
      "So not how much <disfmarker> n not how often it's used , but <disfmarker>\n",
      "W what's what's usual or normal .\n",
      "because I have two televisions at home .\n",
      "One is horizontal ,\n",
      "one is vertical ,\n",
      "it does it doesn't really matter ,\n",
      "I think we have we don't have to decide about that now\n",
      "And the speech uh shall we implement that ?\n",
      "But then you should also find a place <disfmarker>\n",
      "You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something .\n",
      "you can make a very sensitive microphone ,\n",
      "maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh\n",
      "But that's not import I think that's not im very important\n",
      "You could p you could put it in a logo of the company . <vocalsound>\n",
      "between the round of the R_ .\n",
      "but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "just 'cause other remotes don't have that .\n",
      "because a microphone is very small thing ,\n",
      "but you can make it look like it's big\n",
      "so as its its really an important function of the remote .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Interface type .\n",
      "we already s discussed that , huh , the the L_C_D_\n",
      "I think it's better to just <gap> up what you'd like to do on the screen .\n",
      "If you want to go back you have to back button go back ,\n",
      "if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu .\n",
      "the the young people do like uh scroll uh\n",
      "and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options ,\n",
      "you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen .\n",
      "So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down ,\n",
      "And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side\n",
      "there's our five minutes uh warning .\n",
      "what's the standard colour ?\n",
      "we have different colour .\n",
      "You should you should have a black one\n",
      "because uh I think black is standard .\n",
      "Dark grey , something like this this colour or something .\n",
      "I think it's better to have silver nowadays .\n",
      "Yeah the the silver black are our main colours . Yeah .\n",
      "w what about a yellow thing ,\n",
      "it'll be a banana yellow , we have .\n",
      "Green , wood , brown .\n",
      "But if you use uh silver , uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy .\n",
      "I would think about colours like uh red , yellow , green , blue ,\n",
      "The fruity colours and the autumn colours , like red and brown , <gap> dark red and brown .\n",
      "And and do we have to have a normal black one , or uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "uh that wraps it up ?\n",
      "Everybody knows uh what to do ?\n",
      "I wrote it down here . I wrote it down here what to do um .\n",
      "The next meeting is once again in thirty minutes .\n",
      "and especially notice that uh the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board ,\n",

      "I I'd say just wait uh for email and uh find out .\n",
      "welcome everyone .\n",
      "Um as you may have noticed I uh\n",
      "created separate folders\n",

      "save in the folder . Save as project .\n",
      "Um I'm still going to take some minutes ,\n",
      "and if I'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ?\n",
      "And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ?\n",
      "And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice ,\n",
      "the finance uh aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed ,\n",
      "and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation ,\n",
      "This is about the total remote control .\n",
      "We made it green .\n",
      "there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype .\n",
      "And uh the screen light blue .\n",
      "this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under .\n",
      "And the R_ and R_ logo ,\n",
      "Big microphone .\n",
      "just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible .\n",
      "perhaps you should make it a bit big ,\n",
      "so people know it's there\n",
      "The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button .\n",
      "<vocalsound> we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work .\n",
      "You push the scroll button\n",
      "and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out\n",
      "and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available . For example uh T_V_ settings , uh remote settings , et cetera .\n",
      "So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button ,\n",
      "it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu , uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button ,\n",
      "and the opportunity to use the teletext ,\n",
      "and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu , but in uh <disfmarker> Yes . In an apart uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Perhaps we should use the teletext sign\n",
      "this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "Uh the numbers , which is pretty straight forward .\n",
      "but <disfmarker> It's the button where you can switch channels .\n",
      "<gap> just when you are one and you go to two , you can <disfmarker> or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button .\n",
      "And uh in the middle the the mute .\n",
      "Uh battery indicator . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> And this is the uh the on off uh knop , the stand by uh knop .\n",
      "You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh <disfmarker> uh it's taking much part of the screen ,\n",
      "And I just missed when I was typing <disfmarker> The R_R_ stands for ?\n",
      "That's the logo of the <disfmarker>\n",
      "my task was this time to put up a questionnaire\n",
      "by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we <gap> <disfmarker> requirements from the <disfmarker> of the users .\n",
      "Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false ,\n",
      "like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps .\n",
      "One means absolutely not true ,\n",
      "seven <gap> <disfmarker> means true .\n",
      "is the remote control fancy enough ,\n",
      "is it in innovative enough ,\n",
      "and is it easy enough to use .\n",
      "Is the design fancy enough ?\n",
      "it's <disfmarker> looks fancy , especially with the green colour . And the the curves which we decided ,\n",
      "Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ?\n",
      "It uh <disfmarker> oh it's in the background . Oh .\n",
      "it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here ,\n",
      "it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom .\n",
      "Uh make it uh rather thick on the top ,\n",
      "because uh on the top it has uh the screen ,\n",
      "Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ?\n",
      "I think yeah , the battery should be in here ,\n",
      "fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people .\n",
      "I if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it .\n",
      "all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now ,\n",
      "I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also .\n",
      "Alright , it's a one . <vocalsound> Oh it's a one . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Yeah , I think two .\n",
      "It's very fancy , I think .\n",
      "Is it innovative ?\n",
      "because it has an L_C_D_ screen , a mi microphone .\n",
      "And uh uh the scroll is rubber ,\n",
      "Also huh uh-huh <disfmarker> the buttons , are they easy to find ?\n",
      "because they're right on your screen .\n",
      "The options are it <disfmarker> uh little bit harder ,\n",
      "It's easier than the regular uh remote control .\n",
      "I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to\n",
      "where you have to uh find out what <disfmarker> which sign or icon means on uh every button .\n",
      "So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most <disfmarker>\n",
      "I personally think , because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use ,\n",
      "I I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy .\n",
      "but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button ,\n",
      "A two , okay ,\n",
      "It's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people .\n",
      "For young people I think it's easy to use .\n",
      "I think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured . <vocalsound>\n",
      "As well for the for the older people ?\n",
      "Yeah , as well\n",
      "but they they don't want the uh extra options ,\n",
      "And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ?\n",
      "Uh I think it is . If they read a manual .\n",
      "You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition ,\n",
      "then you say the question and the answer .\n",
      "And that's everything it does , the speech recognition .\n",
      "maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them .\n",
      "a three ,\n",
      "Remotes overwhelmed with buttons .\n",
      "Tha that's a one , I think , that's definitely a one .\n",
      "but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad ,\n",
      "I think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed .\n",
      "because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results ,\n",
      "Remote control has uh colours that different <disfmarker> that meet different target groups .\n",
      "'Cause we make them in different colours ,\n",
      "and I though w we had about single colours ,\n",
      "but you can also make uh a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing ,\n",
      "Also with rubber ?\n",
      "You can make a print on rubber ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> The material used is spongy ,\n",
      "that that's uh that's a one ,\n",
      "Yeah , yeah , it's very spongy .\n",
      "because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible ,\n",
      "Remote control is hard to lose .\n",
      "yeah it sh and it's easy to find .\n",
      "Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old .\n",
      "I think I think this is a two , personally .\n",
      "So it should <disfmarker> this question should be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it .\n",
      "so then this is <disfmarker> it is almost true ,\n",
      "Remote control mainly be sold to younger people .\n",
      "I think it will ,\n",
      "No , I don't think very true because the colours .\n",
      "I think it's a three .\n",
      "because w we designed it for young people especially ,\n",
      "Because younger peoples are cr critical\n",
      "and they wanted a lot of features on this thing .\n",
      "n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that ,\n",
      "I think they like the speech .\n",
      "L_C_D_ screen and scroll .\n",
      "It has relatively few features ,\n",
      "those are features .\n",
      "the L_C_D_ <gap> touch screen is feature .\n",
      "The microphone is a feature .\n",
      "aren't the features <disfmarker>\n",
      "and that you can change the channel's feature ,\n",
      "I think it's it's it's a one .\n",
      "you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll thing extra .\n",
      "You can see the remote control is <gap> R_ and R_ .\n",
      "Yeah , there's R_ and R_ in front .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Uh it's not the colour ,\n",
      "so maybe you should make two ,\n",
      "you have the black one .\n",
      "And we'll probably make also a yellow one .\n",
      "but not R_ and R_ yellow I think .\n",
      "but the logo is on on the front ,\n",
      "And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I think it is ,\n",
      "because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options uh entirely explained . Entirely explained .\n",
      ", I'm not not convinc . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I think it would be a t yeah , two .\n",
      "So two , yeah . The average is a two .\n",
      "so it's pretty good .\n",
      "the next part uh might be a little bit difficult to do in a group ,\n",
      "but I am willing to try it .\n",
      "Because we are going to look at the finance\n",
      "and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that .\n",
      "Um and we're going to calculate the production costs ,\n",
      "and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty ,\n",
      "we're good ,\n",
      "and if they're not we're going to uh re-design ,\n",
      "but we have to do that uh very very quick I think ,\n",
      "Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet .\n",
      "The microphone . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in ,\n",
      "so that I can also uh take minutes ,\n",
      "uh count uh number of functions ,\n",
      "because for every button you have to pay <disfmarker>\n",
      "and there are different screen shots , so <disfmarker> or different different screens ,\n",
      "A battery . One battery ,\n",
      "advanced chip ,\n",
      "we have sample speaker .\n",
      "we already on nine .\n",
      "Single nee single curved .\n",
      "Rubber .\n",
      "No , we don't have push button .\n",
      "but with special colour we have .\n",
      "A special form ,\n",
      "We don't got the button supplements .\n",
      "Eighteen and a half ,\n",
      "We have to lower it with six points .\n",
      "We could lose the curve .\n",
      "Nah .\n",
      "We could lose the scroll wheel .\n",
      "You could make it just a regular scroll wheel .\n",
      "if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh <vocalsound> with uh the button .\n",
      "Normal scroll wheel .\n",
      "And I think we should lose the curve .\n",
      "I think we should scrap the sample speaker .\n",
      "then it will <disfmarker> won't uh stand up from the table .\n",
      "Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ?\n",
      "otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "Scrap sample speaker ?\n",
      "you should you should drop the speech recognition .\n",
      "And then you can keep the curve .\n",
      "Or make it on a hand dynamo ,\n",
      "but <vocalsound> I don't think that will work .\n",
      "Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> We could make it titanium instead of rubber .\n",
      "What is special colour ?\n",
      "Is that the wood uh wood uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "I think it is .\n",
      "But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker .\n",
      "Th then we still have too much\n",
      "three . Point three .\n",
      "Let's make it thirteen or fourteen . <vocalsound>\n",
      "That's a scroll wheel . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Don't make it wood .\n",
      "we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood .\n",
      "a all kind of colours ?\n",
      "special colours , fruity colours .\n",
      "but it's a special colour than just rubber colour .\n",
      "You have to add something to the rubber to make it green .\n",
      "then we have to scrap everything we got\n",
      "If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen\n",
      "<vocalsound> then it's possible to make .\n",
      "You lose this one , you got eleven point five\n",
      "How d uh uh how many colours ?\n",
      "but we we we are <disfmarker> we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium .\n",
      "But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour ,\n",
      "but we're gonna make it yellow <disfmarker> uh red ,\n",
      "and then you add <disfmarker> you have two special colours on top of the one we have now .\n",
      "I <disfmarker> then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special <disfmarker>\n",
      "I think you pay half per remote .\n",
      "So each remote with a special colour .\n",
      "You don't need four of those <vocalsound> uh four of those special colours in one in one remote .\n",
      "we have um advanced chip on print .\n",
      "So it would be curved , single curve .\n",
      "we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker .\n",
      "Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped .\n",
      "Perhaps you can save this one ,\n",
      "and then copy or something .\n",
      "but this this new remote we can afford . <vocalsound>\n",
      "When did you receive this list ?\n",
      "I just received it .\n",
      "They don't work so hard at the finance department . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Um and did you try to make a new design ,\n",
      "or what were you trying to do ?\n",
      "I tried to copy that one ,\n",
      "but it didn't work .\n",
      "because I think uh we have a prototype now\n",
      "And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time .\n",
      "And you can't erase this ?\n",
      "Hmm , strange .\n",
      "just leave it at this\n",
      "and quickly save .\n",
      "Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation .\n",
      "what did you think about uh the process ?\n",
      "How satisfied are we ?\n",
      "Deadlines were sometimes very short .\n",
      "Bu but stressful .\n",
      "You think , no , my presentation isn't ready .\n",
      "I think we <disfmarker> it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together .\n",
      "Now we worked through each other ,\n",
      "you had information I didn't have\n",
      "and you had information I also had ,\n",
      "so some some things I had in my presentation , they already told ,\n",
      "I don't think that is the best way to work at <disfmarker> for such project .\n",
      "So you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work .\n",
      "or maybe session of five minutes together or something ,\n",
      "but but why not work here together , for example ?\n",
      "Why should we be separated from each other in those difference <disfmarker> uh different rooms ?\n",
      "probably to simulate the whole working uh process ,\n",
      "like she told . Then you can work together too by mail or by , I dunno , chat , something ,\n",
      "But the technology was uh fantastic . <gap>\n",
      "Yeah , the technology's okay .\n",
      "I I don't really like the board ,\n",
      "but sometimes it doesn't erase\n",
      "perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so\n",
      "and to uh <disfmarker> and lay it next to that keyboard over there .\n",
      "you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful\n",
      "but it doesn't really work all the time .\n",
      "Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below .\n",
      "so it's maybe a bit unnatural also .\n",
      "The project uh <disfmarker> because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh <disfmarker> have , you didn't have time to uh <disfmarker> to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation .\n",
      "So you used uh this uh the different PowerPoint presentations\n",
      "and what about uh this digital pen ?\n",
      "I didn't use it at all . <vocalsound>\n",
      "it's quite handy I think .\n",
      "it did work pretty well .\n",
      "it is easy for <disfmarker> to design something and then load it in your computer .\n",
      "It's b bi little bit too big to write .\n",
      "and what about the teamwork ?\n",
      "Team work was okay .\n",
      "I think it was great ,\n",
      "Yeah , well I think so too .\n",
      "Only thing that we worked through , past each other .\n",
      "the leadership . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> I thought it was good ,\n",
      "yeah , no prob . Ah .\n",
      "And creativity ?\n",
      "when we look at this I'd say we have been creative ,\n",
      "it was the idea to be creative ,\n",
      "And you get get stuff from the from the computer ,\n",
      "The information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late\n",
      "it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema\n",
      "You just sit there for ten minutes .\n",
      "At some times I <disfmarker> Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment ,\n",
      "No , I I never got that .\n",
      "I got like one email after ten minutes or something .\n",
      "I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think , sometimes ,\n",
      "and I never new we have t we had to uh <disfmarker> yeah made a made a rec a remote control .\n",
      "And I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here ,\n",
      "<disfmarker> but after all we can say uh we are satisfied ,\n",
      "but it it could've been uh better .\n",
      "we would have gotten uh more information .\n",
      "more information about the costs .\n",
      "that was a bit mean to put it in the end .\n",
      "um <disfmarker> less heavy laptops .\n",
      "Uh . Faster laptop .\n",
      "And furthermore the the the network was okay .\n",
      "And so more time uh w might have improved the the quality of work ,\n",
      "Five minutes in the meeting .\n",
      "more time during the individual work phases .\n",
      "because we have to have a design ,\n",
      "and that is within the budget .\n",
      "And we evaluated .\n",
      "Maybe we should re-evaluate uh the product ,\n",
      "but we did that before ,\n",
      "and we also evaluated the project .\n",
      "And I think uh everybody's uh very happy . At least I am , with the results ,\n",
      "because uh I have to write the final report now .\n",
      "I I think we have to fill in a questionnaire again ,\n",
      "I think we also have to go to our own rooms again ,\n",
      "But maybe you can try uh to make a screen shot of this ,\n",
      "so I can try to include it in the final report .\n",
      "Yeah ,\n",
      "No ,\n",
      "I hereby officially close the meeting\n",
      "Do you know how how I can wake it up ?\n",
      "I've lost my screen . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound>\n",
      "Never close your laptop .\n",
      "Well , welcome to the kick-off meeting .\n",
      "Well , this is the agenda for today .\n",
      "examples of the tool training , project plan discussion and the closing .\n",
      "Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control .\n",
      "Uh , some of the <vocalsound> oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly .\n",
      "Um , I <disfmarker> oh forget <disfmarker> I forget the whole acquaintance part , but we we all know each other .\n",
      "Uh we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design .\n",
      "Every uh level of design consists of some individual work , and we uh close it with a meeting .\n",
      "Okay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools .\n",
      "This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now .\n",
      "there's a document folder called um the sh <vocalsound> shared document folder .\n",
      "so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen .\n",
      "There is a tool-bar over here .\n",
      "It's like a very simple uh paint application .\n",
      "and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button .\n",
      "and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward ,\n",
      "Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards .\n",
      "Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics ,\n",
      "Well , I'm gonna draw um a p piranha . Uh , a fish .\n",
      "And uh <disfmarker> so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths .\n",
      "but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird .\n",
      "and then we are uh through the tool training , I guess .\n",
      "Okay , this is uh something about the project finance .\n",
      "The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros .\n",
      "And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros .\n",
      "The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide ,\n",
      "and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control .\n",
      "well , we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be .\n",
      "I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls ,\n",
      "but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever .\n",
      "Uh , so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with\n",
      "uh grouped buttons , you know .\n",
      "And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um <disfmarker> what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ?\n",
      "Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders .\n",
      "<gap> I thought it was only for television .\n",
      "So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ .\n",
      "Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well .\n",
      "Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course ,\n",
      "The User Interface Designer <vocalsound>\n",
      "the technical functions design .\n",
      "And the Management Expert of uh <disfmarker> the Marketing Expert . User requirements specifi\n",
      "I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down\n",
      "We'll see each other in uh thirty minutes .\n",
      "Welcome at the functional design meeting , again presented by Maarten .\n",
      "Uh , we've got three presentations .\n",
      "And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me .\n",
      "'Kay , we're going to um uh talk about working design .\n",
      "It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television .\n",
      "Uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights , they're needed and they're uh everywhere available .\n",
      "Uh , the circuit board , it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control .\n",
      "Well , the technical functions .\n",
      "and I think they're <disfmarker> we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user .\n",
      "<vocalsound> th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements ,\n",
      "w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and <disfmarker> we have to choose for novice user .\n",
      "Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions ,\n",
      "uh like just th the channels uh one till nine ,\n",
      "uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that .\n",
      "Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel .\n",
      "and I don't know if there uh are any um <disfmarker> uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that .\n",
      "Uh , I th I thought the the <disfmarker> with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements .\n",
      "there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab\n",
      "and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions .\n",
      "three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly .\n",
      "So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach .\n",
      "Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results .\n",
      "Furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control .\n",
      "Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room .\n",
      "Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever ,\n",
      "And a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh <disfmarker> consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent .\n",
      "Well , then we <disfmarker> I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements\n",
      "Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet .\n",
      "Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off .\n",
      "So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off ,\n",
      "The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market .\n",
      "New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty .\n",
      "It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty .\n",
      "Yeah , but it is <disfmarker> it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that .\n",
      "So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either .\n",
      "Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design .\n",
      "That means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions .\n",
      "Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions .\n",
      "I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to ,\n",
      "No , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the <disfmarker> The new project requirements told us not to <disfmarker>\n",
      "But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind ,\n",
      "No , new requirements say no .\n",
      "Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy .\n",
      "I think stop function is very useful .\n",
      "Yeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but I've never heard of it in the first place . And\n",
      "I think we should just put one teletext button on it .\n",
      "I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present ,\n",
      "No , okay , but we don't have to <disfmarker> uh , when we don't want to uh control other devices , I think it makes it even more simple .\n",
      "uh uh the batteries maybe . If you use large batteries or small batter batteries .\n",
      "I think double A_ .\n",
      "But i in a way we have to be uh uh special .\n",
      "Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can <disfmarker> what the extra touch can be .\n",
      "Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing .\n",
      "Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it ,\n",
      "so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something .\n",
      "So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing .\n",
      "a swapable front or whatever .\n",
      "Yeah , or just different colours would be uh <disfmarker> I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control .\n",
      "Yeah , you have to put it on its <disfmarker> So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table .\n",
      "If you do that , but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise .\n",
      "And then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it uh chargeable . <vocalsound>\n",
      "but when you <disfmarker> you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control , then the then the money <disfmarker> there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , <gap> rechargeable units .\n",
      "Well , maybe yeah , you could <disfmarker> when that's <disfmarker> when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger ,\n",
      "On the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make a nice bay .\n",
      "I mean , it looks trendy and still <vocalsound> still put a bleep function in it ,\n",
      "well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that .\n",
      "And and what people just think about , well , I'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty .\n",
      "We have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work .\n",
      "I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes ,\n",
      "the the s the next minutes won't be a problem ,\n",
      "but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too ,\n",
      "Has anyone got um <vocalsound> a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ?\n",
      "Maybe like this pen .\n",
      "It has to feel nice in your hand .\n",
      "you should like make Alessi or something design it .\n",
      "Yeah , but <vocalsound> twelve and a half Euros ? Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound>\n",
      "I think it uh has to be a r <gap> it has to have round forms or something .\n",
      "Something like that is very ergonomic .\n",
      "And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it . It's also round .\n",
      "Maybe uh , I don't know , some some lights , a big but well .\n",
      "Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons . <gap> <disfmarker>\n",
      "but I also meant the the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote .\n",
      "<gap> maybe put something on top of it <vocalsound> or , you know , like that's <disfmarker> looks funny .\n",
      "I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then .\n",
      "I think we're we're done .\n",
      "Uh , yeah . Uh , before we begin it , I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder ,\n",
      "It uh it uh still some technical difficulties\n",
      "so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other .\n",
      "But uh , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just <vocalsound> ordinary keyboard .\n",
      "Okay , when we talk about uh components design , um it's really about the material and the <disfmarker> and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of .\n",
      "Uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic\n",
      "uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh <disfmarker> yeah , it feels uh good in your hand .\n",
      "I when we use a rubbled <disfmarker> a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to <disfmarker>\n",
      "uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design ,\n",
      "which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . Uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "uh the basic battery ,\n",
      "which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um <disfmarker>\n",
      "Uh here you have to have a hand uh <disfmarker> yeah , kinetic uh energy .\n",
      "Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls .\n",
      "uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird .\n",
      "Oh titanium is probably trendy , I think .\n",
      "Well , maybe a little bit expensive .\n",
      "uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf .\n",
      "all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory .\n",
      "Um , another possibility . I uh yeah , I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays .\n",
      "Could be uh something special to our uh remote control ,\n",
      "and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> I th I got an email with uh some examples and it <disfmarker> these were were the most trendiest one .\n",
      "Yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "um , I still don't have any information about user requirements .\n",
      "I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting .\n",
      "Yeah , but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements .\n",
      "Well , tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi\n",
      "Well , I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of .\n",
      "these are the ones you already summed up in the <disfmarker>\n",
      "Uh , I was also looking for what you said , for <disfmarker> I got an email uh uh about uh L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control .\n",
      "I don't know if that's a good idea , or maybe it's a little bit too much for twelve and a half . Production .\n",
      "I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it . Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting . But <disfmarker>\n",
      "Um , yeah . Well , the functions are are not more to discuss , I think .\n",
      "It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the <disfmarker> no V_C_R_ or that kind of <disfmarker>\n",
      "But you do mention the next and previous uh button .\n",
      "Well , that's next channel . I mean <gap> next channel .\n",
      "And I um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger .\n",
      "Well , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have <disfmarker> yeah , they have to be large .\n",
      "It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t\n",
      "uh personal preference I didn't have .\n",
      "Well , I've done some research again about trends on the internet .\n",
      "the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control .\n",
      "The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the R_C_ .\n",
      "And uh the third point there in this uh order if <disfmarker> of importance , the third point , is a high ease of use .\n",
      "The younger market likes uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well , <gap> the <gap> themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material .\n",
      "Uh , catchy colours .\n",
      "uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself .\n",
      "To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station .\n",
      "Yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want <vocalsound> maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour .\n",
      "But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's <vocalsound> sake with <vocalsound> remote control ?\n",
      "No , but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit .\n",
      "Yeah , but it that doesn't have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the the the the round curves .\n",
      "Well , w we can uh <disfmarker> w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And um , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is uh is n <vocalsound> not easy for a remote control , but m yeah .\n",
      "yeah , I do like uh the f uh to <disfmarker> the idea of making a a y uh , a catchy colour design and a d because I do <disfmarker> I think a dark colour would be nice too .\n",
      "But pictures of fruit , vegetables vegetables <disfmarker>\n",
      "Maybe it's too much , you know .\n",
      "But , we we have to um <disfmarker> There have to be the the the the firm colours , our own uh colours has to be in it .\n",
      "But I don't think our our company colours are this fashionable .\n",
      "If this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here .\n",
      "do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display , for example ?\n",
      "Well , it's nice , of course . But I don't I don't know what to display on it .\n",
      "Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it , for the channel you're on .\n",
      "Yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen , because <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , but <disfmarker> no . I do I think it's a bit redundant , actually .\n",
      "Well well what would you display on it then ?\n",
      "Uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide\n",
      "But you're already watching the T_V_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control .\n",
      "I really understand you want to make your job more exciting <vocalsound> by putting an L_C_D_ in it ,\n",
      "But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image .\n",
      "When when you put uh maybe a colour L_C_D_ t uh screen on it , it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from <disfmarker>\n",
      "well , I'm coming back to the costs again , but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits .\n",
      "and really , I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything , you know , on a design level .\n",
      "Okay , we s skip the <vocalsound> L_C_D_ display .\n",
      "The m material , I think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber . Uh\n",
      "Maybe just bring it out in different colours ,\n",
      "but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that's also too much .\n",
      "But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium , as well ?\n",
      "But it it <disfmarker> then it uh <disfmarker> you can't throw it it . It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff\n",
      "Uh , I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic .\n",
      "On the other hand , if you want to make fruit <disfmarker> fruity stuff with uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , but I I really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing .\n",
      "But wha th our basic idea <disfmarker> y I mean , you gonna <disfmarker> we're probably gonna have like two type of materials , like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it .\n",
      "How many colours are we gonna give it ?\n",
      "Like two-tone colour ? T\n",
      "I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , <vocalsound> and the cushions as well should be in another colour .\n",
      "Not more than two colours I think .\n",
      "It's a g a little bit too flashy .\n",
      "Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh uh ten uh rem\n",
      "A mute and a teletext and a menu .\n",
      "I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s uh side .\n",
      "I think this is kind of fruity , you know . Just round shapes with uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "I think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but <disfmarker> and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying ,\n",
      "Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute .\n",
      "Well , you will read the minutes uh in the <disfmarker> you can find them in the <disfmarker>\n",
      "In the shared folder .\n",
      "because I'm will now type them out .\n",
      "What are we going to do now ?\n",
      "You'll see in you email , I guess .\n",
      "Okay , welcome to the detailed design meeting .\n",
      "Oh , we're gonna have a prototype presentation first .\n",
      "'Kay , we've made a prototype .\n",
      "especially we looked at the form , material and the colour .\n",
      "The logo is uh is uh <vocalsound> is pretty uh <vocalsound> obvious to see on the on the remote control ,\n",
      "I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious .\n",
      "Uh , power button .\n",
      "Uh then the the the nine uh channels .\n",
      "Uh the volume uh uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes .\n",
      "And then we had uh just uh two buttons , we place them in the middle , uh the menu , and for the teletext\n",
      "did we want to have a m mute button ?\n",
      "Alright , and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button .\n",
      "Yeah , but you you gotta make it clear on the <disfmarker> on <disfmarker>\n",
      "Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually .\n",
      "Uh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh <vocalsound> do uh like\n",
      "uh d I call it teens and twenties .\n",
      "All n no , that's um <vocalsound> kinda dependent on the television .\n",
      "but do we have <disfmarker> do we need extra buttons ,\n",
      "I think you should add <disfmarker> <vocalsound>\n",
      "A cross , or whatever . Yeah , line .\n",
      "Yeah , but you don't you don't actually need them ,\n",
      "becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds <disfmarker>\n",
      "No , that's dependent on the television .\n",
      "I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty <disfmarker> uh a number in the twenty or in the ten .\n",
      "Yes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> they come with the television .\n",
      "when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one ,\n",
      "some televisions don't accept uh that that <disfmarker>\n",
      "When you push the button , the remote control gives a signal .\n",
      "and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one .\n",
      "it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space .\n",
      "Yeah , but it's exact the same <gap> that w would appear when you put a separate button <disfmarker> push a separate button .\n",
      "Yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons .\n",
      "Yeah , but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point .\n",
      "that special but button <gap> you're talking about , eh ?\n",
      "That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in <disfmarker> on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it .\n",
      "When you don't have that separate button , and you push y one , it's exactly the same thing .\n",
      "No , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c\n",
      "That's the same thing as the button with the one and it <disfmarker>\n",
      "It's simply not true . It's simply not true .\n",
      "I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works .\n",
      "We'll discuss them in the usability lab .\n",
      "we'll apply them then for now .\n",
      "I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary .\n",
      "Yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two .\n",
      "but I still think i it it <disfmarker> all T_V_s in some ways support it ,\n",
      "I think it's more c is m maybe we don't <disfmarker> uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works ,\n",
      "but I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said .\n",
      "No , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals .\n",
      "I think it's pretty basic ,\n",
      "there's one there's one button ,\n",
      "But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell ,\n",
      "because Real <vocalsound> Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls .\n",
      "So maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh M_P_ three players or or uh\n",
      "I think that's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices .\n",
      "Yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "The technology and the voltage can be the same . That's uh that's true .\n",
      "When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it .\n",
      "Shouldn't it fall then ? It <disfmarker> isn't going to fall down ?\n",
      "No , when you make it large enough no it it will not .\n",
      "But it's just an idea .\n",
      "It's leaning . It's leaning backwards , I think , in the in the docking station .\n",
      "Uh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh <disfmarker> in in the <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later ,\n",
      "because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues <vocalsound> still to come .\n",
      "the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control ,\n",
      "because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area .\n",
      "Then your uh left thumb of uh <disfmarker> your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button ,\n",
      "which is the most common used uh function ,\n",
      "Yes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber ,\n",
      "and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it .\n",
      "Yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it .\n",
      "because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber ,\n",
      "Then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons .\n",
      "Uh , in the same colour as the side .\n",
      "But uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours ,\n",
      "Right , we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together .\n",
      "we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> The remote control is not ugly . How do you feel ?\n",
      "Yeah , maybe it really depends on taste .\n",
      "I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , but we d we didn't <disfmarker> we're we're not planning to use fronts , I believe .\n",
      "No , not not fronts , but different designs .\n",
      "Okay , three .\n",
      "The remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy .\n",
      "Yeah well , let that <disfmarker> let's make that a one . <vocalsound>\n",
      "The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible .\n",
      "It's something we really put work into .\n",
      "I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant .\n",
      "The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons .\n",
      "I think we totally succeeded there .\n",
      "Well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something .\n",
      "Also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits ,\n",
      "The remote control has got a really trendy look .\n",
      "Yeah , uh a t I think a two .\n",
      "we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever .\n",
      "But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful .\n",
      "You agree on the two ?\n",
      "Remote control has got innovative technology implanted .\n",
      "No , not L_C_D_ , so .\n",
      "you mean the rubber stuff ?\n",
      "But that that's not innovative .\n",
      "Or seven maybe , <vocalsound> yeah .\n",
      "With the lights it <disfmarker> it's it's kind of future <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yes . <vocalsound> The docking station is a is a little bit innovative .\n",
      "Well , let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway .\n",
      "No uh , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so I think we <disfmarker>\n",
      "<gap> how would you innovate a remote control more ?\n",
      "Yeah , more through uh like function T_V_ functionalities and <disfmarker>\n",
      "But I d I definitely don't think it's a five ,\n",
      "think about it la later on\n",
      "Remote control is easy to use .\n",
      "It will be bought by people under the age of forty .\n",
      "Yeah . Definitely .\n",
      "Yeah , a two .\n",
      "The remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan .\n",
      "Yeah , you can put that on the side if <vocalsound> if we would like to .\n",
      "Yeah , and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three .\n",
      "Remote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users .\n",
      "Yeah , make it a two .\n",
      "It's a two point six .\n",
      "which is uh quite a great score .\n",
      "Is there something after this uh meeting ? Or <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well , I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire .\n",
      "I received uh a spreadsheet .\n",
      "I'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together ,\n",
      "First of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list .\n",
      "We include one battery .\n",
      "we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them .\n",
      "we should know how many simple chips , regular chips <disfmarker>\n",
      "The simple chip is e enough I I think ,\n",
      "I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use , really .\n",
      "The the email I got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like I think the advanced chip <disfmarker> maybe .\n",
      "Maybe you can uh look it up right now .\n",
      "well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess .\n",
      "Yeah , but it will it will it will be <disfmarker> cause a lot of problems .\n",
      "Okay , we went for the double-curved case\n",
      "made out of plastic and rubber . And with a special colour .\n",
      "Otherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour .\n",
      "Yeah , I think we uh we have special colours .\n",
      "Okay , then the push-button , I was just counting them .\n",
      "Uh , I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use ,\n",
      "Well that's bit of a problem ,\n",
      "because I re but I really don't understand that , because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet .\n",
      "it's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much .\n",
      "Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons .\n",
      "You can have f four kind of push-buttons .\n",
      "And plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it's will be uh eighteen .\n",
      "Why is that so uh expensive .\n",
      "Yeah , I don't understand .\n",
      "Well , okay , well well let's make it just one .\n",
      "I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . Really .\n",
      "I've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume ,\n",
      "Yeah , but I d I wouldn't want to own that . Really .\n",
      "Uh , it's it's still for little children .\n",
      "But then still , <vocalsound> when we <disfmarker> there's no room for a docking station or something .\n",
      "We'll give the buttons special colour .\n",
      "We'll give them a special form .\n",
      "<vocalsound> A special colour , why a special colour ?\n",
      "Because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings .\n",
      "I don't think the special form is really true .\n",
      "I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that's what we were planning to do ,\n",
      "'Kay , but the problem now is that <vocalsound> the <disfmarker> There's no such thing as a docking station in this list ,\n",
      "but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents .\n",
      "<vocalsound> But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station <disfmarker>\n",
      "then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore ,\n",
      "No , but you <disfmarker> otherwise you can't retrieve it .\n",
      "I mean if it's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents .\n",
      "But for two Euros and thirty cents , we uh we don't get a docking station .\n",
      "if it would cost two Euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too ,\n",
      "or we can ki do the kinetic cells .\n",
      "But uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ?\n",
      "Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now ,\n",
      "yeah , but when we skip when we um <disfmarker> when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still <disfmarker> yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special ,\n",
      "We can make a plain docking station for two Euros .\n",
      "Wi wi without recharge <disfmarker>\n",
      "I've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or <disfmarker>\n",
      "You can look at it for s presentation .\n",
      "I don't think here <disfmarker> it's in here already .\n",
      "Was it working design or components design ?\n",
      "You know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker>\n",
      "Okay , so we only need a simple chip .\n",
      "it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip .\n",
      "And what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ?\n",
      "Maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down .\n",
      "So we're gonna use the simple chip .\n",
      "Nah , there is some money left to be spent .\n",
      "I think we can make a docking station . Yeah .\n",
      "we aren't gonna apply any uh innovated <disfmarker> innovative te technology anyway , I think .\n",
      "maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something .\n",
      "Instead of the rechargeable <disfmarker>\n",
      "Kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking .\n",
      "the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking <gap> .\n",
      "Hey that <disfmarker> maybe that's cool <disfmarker> that's a cool thing about it , you know . You don't use batteries .\n",
      "We can make a docking station for two thirty .\n",
      "Yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control .\n",
      "but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the <disfmarker> these costs of the speaker and other stuff .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Well then it's a useless project .\n",
      "Yeah , then we don't have any innovation things .\n",
      "Uh maybe it <disfmarker> with the kinetic thing , I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing .\n",
      "Can't we say fifteen Euros ?\n",
      "No , then we have to sell it for thirty Euros .\n",
      "You can sell for twenty seven and a half .\n",
      "Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . Battery and kinetic .\n",
      "You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really .\n",
      "Uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time .\n",
      "Because I think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know ,\n",
      "with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , it's funny for a week .\n",
      "Okay , then we d Okay , well y we don't have to do it , but what <disfmarker> that would just have a lack of key features , you know .\n",
      "We can really can do the docking thing ,\n",
      "Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station .\n",
      "No no , it's not possible .\n",
      "<vocalsound> It w it won't tell , but <disfmarker>\n",
      "No , this not gonna sell . No .\n",
      "Yeah , we just have to go all what we did today again . You have to do it over .\n",
      "No no uh there's still there's still someth concept and something special left .\n",
      "Yeah , and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature ,\n",
      "Warning , finish meeting now .\n",
      "well , we were gonna what look <disfmarker> take a look at the last sheet .\n",
      "No , we can't .\n",
      "Yeah , we have to <disfmarker> Yeah , it's <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> No .\n",
      "Yes , yes . Celebration .\n",
      "I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest .\n",
      "<vocalsound> <vocalsound> I've uh made a presentation\n",
      "uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard , so we can all see it .\n",
      "Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting .\n",
      "So uh <vocalsound> I'm the Project Manager ,\n",
      "And <gap> an uh a nice agenda . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Uh we'll do the opening\n",
      "and then uh we'll meet each other ,\n",
      "I'll I'll show you the the tools we have here , so that we can all use them .\n",
      "We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project ,\n",
      "and then uh we'll close the meeting ,\n",
      "and then we can uh individually uh do our things\n",
      "and then uh we'll get back here .\n",
      "We have to uh design a new television remote control .\n",
      "Um we want it to be original ,\n",
      "so a nice uh a nice new design .\n",
      "Uh trendy , it's <vocalsound> also for young people ,\n",
      "and we have to just uh make it uh modern .\n",
      "And uh friendly ,\n",
      "so size does matter .\n",
      "And uh <disfmarker> Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place , that kin those kind of things .\n",
      "There happen to be uh three stages .\n",
      "functional , conceptual , and d detailed design .\n",
      "Um so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , uh and then go into the next phase .\n",
      "We have uh these two Smartboards .\n",
      "Um well as I just showed , there's a project management folder , a project document folder on the desktop .\n",
      "It just works exactly the same as a computer .\n",
      "You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop .\n",
      "Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things ,\n",
      "This is a uh well a drawing board .\n",
      "<gap> you have a <disfmarker> these different uh functions on the board .\n",
      "So you have a a nice pen ,\n",
      "and it's works just like a bal ball pen .\n",
      "Of course w <vocalsound> doesn't work any more . <vocalsound>\n",
      "We can uh uh well you can save a file .\n",
      "So if uh we draw we have to save everything .\n",
      "Uh just we can start a new one , and we just go on , and don't throw anything away .\n",
      "Um you can here select a pen ,\n",
      "It's a bit uh childish you have to write .\n",
      "It's not as fast as you w you know it ,\n",
      "but it does work sometimes .\n",
      "We going to try it .\n",
      "So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board ,\n",
      "Alright , your favourite animal ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast\n",
      "I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment .\n",
      "We're kinda losing time , though .\n",
      "Ah <vocalsound> the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose , loosen up , a bit uh meeting each other\n",
      "It's a hedgehog .\n",
      "and now uh our Industrial Designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal .\n",
      "It's a rabbit .\n",
      "save it and start a new uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "These are very important documents , of course , uh these drawings , uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah well we have to save everything\n",
      "There's also different colours\n",
      "and different uh well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness .\n",
      "It's just a bird .\n",
      "you choose a new colour .\n",
      "<vocalsound> And a new pen width uh <gap> also format .\n",
      "It's a cat . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Well then uh the serious uh stuff .\n",
      "We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally\n",
      "um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars , but uh twenty five Euros .\n",
      "Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros .\n",
      "So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell .\n",
      "<vocalsound> <gap> we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros\n",
      "so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research .\n",
      "Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls ,\n",
      "first <gap> about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera ?\n",
      "Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls ?\n",
      "Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh <disfmarker> <gap>\n",
      "it's not , it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls ,\n",
      "Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then <disfmarker>\n",
      "I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors .\n",
      "Get the good points\n",
      "uh try to merge them into one universal remote control .\n",
      "On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce .\n",
      "Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player\n",
      "Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe ,\n",
      "because we want to we want to <gap> well fifty million ?\n",
      "No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh\n",
      "and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise .\n",
      "I also think we should not add too many buttons .\n",
      "Modern day uh remotes have <vocalsound> too much buttons I think .\n",
      "Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's <gap>\n",
      "Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_\n",
      "and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something .\n",
      "so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "and maybe we do uh <vocalsound> we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player .\n",
      "we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we uh we make ?\n",
      "And stereo uh s uh audio installations .\n",
      "And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes .\n",
      "because we look at competitors\n",
      "and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design <disfmarker>\n",
      "It has to be different and familiar at the same time .\n",
      "we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things .\n",
      "I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing <gap>\n",
      "you can make it uh triangle shaped ,\n",
      "but that's not uh very recognisable .\n",
      "Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and <disfmarker>\n",
      "N we can use uh it as a as a game pad .\n",
      "So <vocalsound> one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound>\n",
      "<gap> but young people want something different\n",
      "Yeah but it's quite important that it fits .\n",
      "one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to <disfmarker> we can imagine uh\n",
      "so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful\n",
      "for me personally I have a <vocalsound> a lot of remotes uh at home\n",
      "but <vocalsound> those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle <vocalsound> I don't like to use them .\n",
      "When it falls over it and I just have <disfmarker> and then the button that I use most has to be here .\n",
      "It shouldn't be boxy .\n",
      "I don't agree with the long box uh shape <vocalsound>\n",
      "But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this ,\n",
      "and you can make it another shape ,\n",
      "No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ <gap> with their uh remotes <vocalsound> pl players <vocalsound> they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped .\n",
      "No that's ol old fashioned .\n",
      "Well <vocalsound> most of <gap> of them are are somewhat thicker at the end ,\n",
      "and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end .\n",
      "uh but then with some uh round uh <vocalsound> round forms in it to fit your hand ,\n",
      "A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand .\n",
      "It shouldn't be too boxy , you know .\n",
      "but <disfmarker> no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square\n",
      "but a also with round edges of course ,\n",
      "but in in in at the end it's still this long <vocalsound> box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh <vocalsound> to fit .\n",
      "A big recognisable button on top or something .\n",
      "The buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course ,\n",
      "and uh n uh uh not too close uh together .\n",
      "But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button .\n",
      "Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions .\n",
      "and maybe we should use colours .\n",
      "Yeah <gap> maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well <gap> <vocalsound> you can you can put on on them ,\n",
      "and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs <vocalsound>\n",
      "That's kinda trendy .\n",
      "Sound nice . Yes .\n",
      "I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well it's just uh about our first ideas now\n",
      "so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make ,\n",
      "You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh . I think .\n",
      "So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over .\n",
      "Yeah now we can still talk about the material ,\n",
      "I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic ,\n",
      "the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh .\n",
      "Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy .\n",
      "Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons\n",
      "Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television\n",
      "infrared beams an infrared beam I think <gap> .\n",
      "It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things .\n",
      "The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ?\n",
      "Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes .\n",
      "and you can always use a front front on it , you know ?\n",
      "You can use it <vocalsound> just plain\n",
      "but you can <vocalsound> <disfmarker> To make it more trendy .\n",
      "And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well you can make profit with them ,\n",
      "and it's <vocalsound> a way to make them trendy .\n",
      "Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something\n",
      "Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell ,\n",
      "so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so <disfmarker>\n",
      "But people of often don't like bright colours or something .\n",
      "We have to make it grey or s or black .\n",
      "But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh <gap> I don't know what your specific instructions will be , but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote .\n",
      "And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think .\n",
      "Finish meeting now .\n",
      "Well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so <disfmarker>\n",
      "Next meeting is in <disfmarker>\n",
      "In thirty minutes ,\n",
      "Well our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in .\n",
      "Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them .\n",
      "Well , teletext goes out .\n",
      "I I disagree ,\n",
      "because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_\n",
      "and they don't want it ,\n",
      "because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years .\n",
      "Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products .\n",
      "Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements .\n",
      "Well , <vocalsound> um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly .\n",
      "They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls .\n",
      "Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity .\n",
      "Furthermore , it's uh <vocalsound> seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot .\n",
      "Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb .\n",
      "A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their <vocalsound> in their living room .\n",
      "So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily .\n",
      "Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn .\n",
      "I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . Uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think .\n",
      "It sh it should be there , the manual .\n",
      "So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than <disfmarker> I think .\n",
      "Next point . Um R_S_I_ .\n",
      "Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device .\n",
      "Uh <disfmarker> I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that .\n",
      "It's going to be expensive . Yeah .\n",
      "I don't have any information on that . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound>\n",
      "No , we'll look we'll look into that later .\n",
      "And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition .\n",
      "They also like that ,\n",
      "I think that's uh difficult to realise also .\n",
      "We don't rule them out uh yet .\n",
      "Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design .\n",
      "You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control ,\n",
      "And the <vocalsound> the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip ,\n",
      "The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course .\n",
      "Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set ,\n",
      "I've some couple of pictures here .\n",
      "It has uh very little buttons and <disfmarker>\n",
      "High tech . <vocalsound>\n",
      "and it's not very user-friendly .\n",
      "So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that ,\n",
      "uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly ,\n",
      "Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons .\n",
      "Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext .\n",
      "But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences .\n",
      "but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ .\n",
      "Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this .\n",
      "Yeah . If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel .\n",
      "That's very irritating , I think .\n",
      "But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb .\n",
      "and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach ,\n",
      "And I have some pictures of the inside workings ,\n",
      "Yeah . Well I'm Mike <gap> , User Interface Designer .\n",
      "took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two .\n",
      "Um <disfmarker> This one is engineering-centred ,\n",
      "I like user-centr centred uh <vocalsound> uh also the best .\n",
      "I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need .\n",
      "<vocalsound> I um I kinda like the shape .\n",
      "I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front .\n",
      "but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company .\n",
      "So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone .\n",
      "Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote .\n",
      "We can put it on the on the back side .\n",
      "We can make a symbol of the company right here .\n",
      "And <vocalsound> if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front . So the symbol's always on\n",
      "Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ?\n",
      "Yeah , I will .\n",
      "and we've uh chose for the younger one .\n",
      "Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features .\n",
      "but what kind of features ?\n",
      "Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition .\n",
      "And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information .\n",
      "Which programme you are l watching or something .\n",
      "So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have ,\n",
      "No not clickable .\n",
      "I think it should be at the top .\n",
      "Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ?\n",
      "Uh well I think so , yes . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "<vocalsound> Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost .\n",
      "No but we're we'll have to look into that .\n",
      "So we have to decide on the different remote control functions .\n",
      "Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural .\n",
      "because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom .\n",
      "We don't want them to look like a calculator .\n",
      "I think it's still important to have it at the top ,\n",
      "because it's uh it's more familiar that way .\n",
      "I think we have uh a few functions ,\n",
      "and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it ,\n",
      "and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand .\n",
      "Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons <disfmarker>\n",
      "Volume control .\n",
      "Uh the mute button .\n",
      "I think we we should use something like this um to um <disfmarker> The the channel up and channel down button ? <vocalsound> Yeah , in circle , you know ?\n",
      "And and a volume control also in it .\n",
      "You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance .\n",
      "I think these should be in one big circle in the middle .\n",
      "Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was <vocalsound> t kinda true .\n",
      "So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other .\n",
      "Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place .\n",
      "So the the <vocalsound> channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down .\n",
      "No I don't think .\n",
      "I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together ,\n",
      "but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together .\n",
      "Right , just make some decisions .\n",
      "Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions ,\n",
      "and the design comes into the next round ?\n",
      "Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ?\n",
      "On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other , <vocalsound> d it <disfmarker>\n",
      "Alright so no button for that .\n",
      "Uh there's um <vocalsound> screen . You can make it wider and less wide .\n",
      "And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video .\n",
      "I do think we have to put that underneath a clip .\n",
      "Th that's a bit uh waste .\n",
      "But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section .\n",
      "You can just put it somewhere\n",
      "Oh , they can be small or round like buttons .\n",
      "Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah .\n",
      "We have it , and we design later where everything goes . Yeah .\n",
      "Why go to video ?\n",
      "Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting ,\n",
      "Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah , sk <vocalsound>\n",
      "and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "So we still <gap> have one uh four ?\n",
      "For a screen uh fu uh channel setting .\n",
      "Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu .\n",
      "Yeah , alright .\n",
      "Menu button .\n",
      "Yeah . I think that's important .\n",
      "Channel , yeah .\n",
      "I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah .\n",
      "And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something .\n",
      "and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So <disfmarker>\n",
      "We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design .\n",
      "Alright , Trendwatch .\n",
      "It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too .\n",
      "Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Uh the last point is easy to use .\n",
      "Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use .\n",
      "Well we have to choose one of them . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use .\n",
      "So it must be very bright , very colourful .\n",
      "Fruit and vegetables are cool .\n",
      "Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong .\n",
      "I was thinking of something like uh <vocalsound> well uh iron plate over it ,\n",
      "Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year .\n",
      "Yeah , that's great .\n",
      "Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design .\n",
      "Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough ,\n",
      "but it doesn't have a really really tough look . So <disfmarker>\n",
      "Uh the buttons of course rubber ,\n",
      "I think everyone agrees .\n",
      "Um under forty five years old .\n",
      "Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours .\n",
      "Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said ,\n",
      "And also they like curved round shapes .\n",
      "Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something .\n",
      "So it it looks pretty but it feels strong .\n",
      "uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery .\n",
      "But solar energy is not very practical inside a house ,\n",
      "And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote ,\n",
      "And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case .\n",
      "Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium .\n",
      "Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons .\n",
      "No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that ,\n",
      "But we do use an L_C_D_ screen ,\n",
      "so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip ,\n",
      "Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems ,\n",
      "Um it's not really speech recognition ,\n",
      "and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left .\n",
      "No it doesn't does not do anything .\n",
      "Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote .\n",
      "Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and <gap> uh and that kind of stuff <vocalsound>\n",
      "um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons .\n",
      "Can you draw it now ?\n",
      "So you have a menu button ,\n",
      "and then you can go up and down .\n",
      "But then we should also have an uh an Okay button .\n",
      "I suggest a banana shape .\n",
      "m Next year that's out .\n",
      "Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ?\n",
      "And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ?\n",
      "Um the video button should be uh an apart button ,\n",
      "Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out .\n",
      "But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part .\n",
      "if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should .\n",
      "Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy .\n",
      "This is my suggested design .\n",
      "Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make .\n",
      "And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom .\n",
      "Yeah , fine . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I think we should , if it's um possible , uh one with colours , but <disfmarker>\n",
      "Nah th It's too expensive .\n",
      "You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is .\n",
      "So it f falls over the hand .\n",
      "I will design it , we design it later .\n",
      "Well a case ? Uh that's me .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium ,\n",
      "And then the front is made of plastic .\n",
      "And you can put that on and off ,\n",
      "But the feel of plastic isn't strong . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Titanium back , plastic front .\n",
      "When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match .\n",
      "but you know b Titanium is very basic colour ,\n",
      "and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front .\n",
      "all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work .\n",
      "Uh the buttons are normal , etcetera .\n",
      "Um well we have our beautiful drawing .\n",
      "Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder ,\n",
      "and then I'll put it in our end report .\n",
      "I think we can launch a couple of packages .\n",
      "We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot .\n",
      "Launch different lines at once .\n",
      "Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so ,\n",
      "and that they want more .\n",
      "Yeah but you you can have some basic colours ,\n",
      "yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour , we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch , when we uh <vocalsound> well introduce our remote .\n",
      "Maybe a a cheap voice recording .\n",
      "We all agree on that . Yeah .\n",
      "Industry designer , <gap> . User Interface , Mike . You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .\n",
      "Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means ,\n",
      "but uh you'll get uh the specifications .\n",
      "Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ?\n",
      "Yeah . Round .\n",
      "Well yeah . Um I think um <vocalsound> a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be <disfmarker>\n",
      "Uh I I'd say only the logo .\n",
      "Well , our slogan is not very long .\n",
      "But you can put it on the back ,\n",
      "Ah the logo should be on the top I think .\n",
      "Right corner , yes .\n",
      "But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front .\n",
      "The logo can be on on every uh front .\n",
      "Okay .\n",
      "Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo\n",
      "and logo also on the front\n",
      "So uh a little corner of titanium .\n",
      "Yes , <gap> that also sounds uh pretty uh neat .\n",
      "Alright .\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "this is our design .\n",
      "Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting .\n",
      "We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape .\n",
      "Th So there's this part um <vocalsound> which is made of hard plastic , the front .\n",
      "And uh we're we're using different colours .\n",
      "Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours ,\n",
      "and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .\n",
      "and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium ,\n",
      "Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner ,\n",
      "uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part .\n",
      "It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo <disfmarker>\n",
      "I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .\n",
      "the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here .\n",
      "Um um with kind of arrow shapes ,\n",
      "we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers .\n",
      "Menu for the L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "And the video button .\n",
      "And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "And we thought about the logo big in the middle .\n",
      "And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo .\n",
      "the voice recorder is uh at the bottom .\n",
      "If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands .\n",
      "And how large is it ?\n",
      "That's the question .\n",
      "Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it .\n",
      "But you you hold it like this .\n",
      "Well the the <disfmarker> Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree\n",
      "and only Nils <disfmarker>\n",
      "<vocalsound> For me , I I wouldn't buy it .\n",
      "So <vocalsound> let it be like this at uh at this moment .\n",
      "I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation .\n",
      "That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria .\n",
      "So I made a <disfmarker> I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends .\n",
      "Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ?\n",
      "So I think it's very good-looking\n",
      "Easy to change channels ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ?\n",
      "Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so ,\n",
      "R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ?\n",
      "Uh well well a bit ,\n",
      "Are there enough technology ?\n",
      "Three .\n",
      "Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ?\n",
      "Three , alright .\n",
      "Is the material attractive ?\n",
      "So I would say at least two .\n",
      "look at the costs at this point .\n",
      "My god .\n",
      "The sample speaker ,\n",
      "Kick it out .\n",
      "Then we go to fourteen point six .\n",
      "Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ?\n",
      "Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said .\n",
      "What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ?\n",
      "but it wasn't very clear .\n",
      "Yeah , we need to have the <vocalsound> the L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there ,\n",
      "because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour .\n",
      "But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "We can also make it flat .\n",
      "Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah .\n",
      "No , it's one curve .\n",
      "W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half .\n",
      "Well we make it more expensive to buy .\n",
      "Well , then we have two dollars less profit .\n",
      "If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing .\n",
      "Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium ,\n",
      "Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy .\n",
      "I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days .\n",
      "I I'll talk to the managers . <vocalsound>\n",
      "So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid .\n",
      "But then we can add the special colour ?\n",
      "As we have money over uh left . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Well I think uh the case is double curved then .\n",
      "Well y we have curves in all directions .\n",
      "So <disfmarker> alright .\n",
      "but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project ,\n",
      "are we satisfactory about our creativity ?\n",
      "Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah .\n",
      "I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment .\n",
      "and you had to dump all your creativity .\n",
      "Uh leadership\n",
      "Well it's <vocalsound> <disfmarker> It was very democratic . <vocalsound>\n",
      "<vocalsound> Well the managers were terrible . So , with their all their useless requirements .\n",
      "teamwork ?\n",
      "Well great I think .\n",
      "Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ?\n",
      "It was a complete disaster .\n",
      "<vocalsound> That one isn't accurate .\n",
      "But I I think this is meant by the digital pen .\n",
      "Uh <vocalsound> a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing .\n",
      "And uh the digi the digital pen ?\n",
      "It isn't practical . Right .\n",
      "Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . I I agree on that .\n",
      "<vocalsound> N new ideas found ?\n",
      "Well I missed uh the option to uh to email ,\n",
      "Communicate in between .\n",
      "The first kick-off meeting .\n",
      "First the opening ,\n",
      "then the rest .\n",
      "We m have to make a new remote control .\n",
      "It has to be original , trendy and user-friendly .\n",
      "So we will get back th on that .\n",
      "First we have to make a functional design .\n",
      "After that we have to make a conceptual design ,\n",
      "and then after that a detailed design .\n",
      "So we'll discuss that later .\n",
      "So first to <disfmarker> we have to make a small painting .\n",
      "First you can save the documents .\n",
      "We have to do that every time we make something .\n",
      "And we have to use <vocalsound> the pen and the eraser .\n",
      "We all have to use this one .\n",
      "So I'll make an example .\n",
      "Um you can change some things .\n",
      "Um format , line , and change it . <gap> <disfmarker>\n",
      "<vocalsound> And you can change the colour .\n",
      "An elephant . <vocalsound>\n",
      "So and after it you have to save it .\n",
      "<vocalsound> So you're next .\n",
      "Uh a bird .\n",
      "Now save ?\n",
      "Now next . The budget .\n",
      "we will sell the t at twenty five Euros .\n",
      "And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it .\n",
      "First I wanna hear from you .\n",
      "Uh what are your experiences with remote controls .\n",
      "Big one , they are uh not easy to use .\n",
      "And uh g big buttons ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> m uh that's easier to use than uh <disfmarker> I think .\n",
      "Big buttons , positive .\n",
      "Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set .\n",
      "And that it controls the channels and the the volume .\n",
      "And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote .\n",
      "And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working .\n",
      "But I <disfmarker> my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that .\n",
      "Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver .\n",
      "We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that .\n",
      "That's not really ea easy .\n",
      "So it would be nice if we have one for all .\n",
      "For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it .\n",
      "So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ?\n",
      "The weight . Not not too heavy .\n",
      "Not much buttons .\n",
      "That when you drop it , it won't break .\n",
      "Like uh some kind of rubber on it .\n",
      "Or hard uh hard plastic .\n",
      "Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it .\n",
      "When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some <gap> <disfmarker> uh some sort of bleep .\n",
      "Yeah well that's <disfmarker> that are good ideas . Uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material .\n",
      "So probably plastic or something . Uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah I think it uh <disfmarker> from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice .\n",
      "on our website we can see what products we already have .\n",
      "And it should work with as many uh as possible of them .\n",
      "Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries .\n",
      "So you don't <disfmarker> won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks .\n",
      "It's only the first ideas .\n",
      "uh what are we going to do now is <disfmarker> Next meeting is in half an h hour .\n",
      "Um , what you have to do . Well look on your <gap> .\n",
      "And <disfmarker> Next instructions you'll get in your email . So <disfmarker>\n",
      "Okay .\n",
      "So welcome back .\n",
      "first . I want to say I'm the secretary ,\n",
      "so I make the minutes .\n",
      "You find them in your <disfmarker> in the map in the From the group .\n",
      "There's the minutes from the first meeting .\n",
      "You'll find the next minutes also there .\n",
      "I wanna hear from you , what you've done .\n",
      "And after that I have some new product requirements . So <disfmarker>\n",
      "And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do .\n",
      "We have forty minutes for this meeting .\n",
      "After that we'll have lunch .\n",
      "So first I wanna ask the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So <disfmarker>\n",
      "Where have I put it ?\n",
      "I've save it on my computer , my presentation .\n",
      "But now I don't know where it is .\n",
      "Okay here it is .\n",
      "It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you .\n",
      "It's about the working of the remote control .\n",
      "I just had an half an hour j to study it\n",
      "and <vocalsound> I don't get it .\n",
      "First uh I will tell you something about the findings ,\n",
      "what I discovered about the remote control .\n",
      "Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map ,\n",
      "and it's the top of the remote control .\n",
      "The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside .\n",
      "Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it ,\n",
      "um because its uh not so expensive .\n",
      "And there are uh a lot of uh wires ,\n",
      "uh which um connect the components in it ,\n",
      "and there are um switches and things like that .\n",
      "There's a lot of small uh electronics .\n",
      "So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it .\n",
      "Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it .\n",
      "And here I have the top of the remote control .\n",
      "Uh here's some kind of chip .\n",
      "Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers .\n",
      "Uh you have all on your remote control .\n",
      "And uh the teletext uh button .\n",
      "And uh here's the battery .\n",
      "And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip .\n",
      "And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components .\n",
      "My preferences ?\n",
      "We shouldn't make it too big .\n",
      "Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it .\n",
      "A long-lasting battery .\n",
      "Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic .\n",
      "Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it .\n",
      "We can also make uh a button uh with a <gap> <disfmarker> menu uh button .\n",
      "And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ .\n",
      "And the bleep signal , y uh you told us .\n",
      "Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep .\n",
      "And also the bleep , when <disfmarker> what I told you about uh when you lost it ,\n",
      "and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it .\n",
      "The battery .\n",
      "You say one battery is cheaper .\n",
      "If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two .\n",
      "when you use two , you can use it two times longer .\n",
      "then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting .\n",
      "Okay and the buttons .\n",
      "When you use it on the television , you've <disfmarker> you need the television , wh which can use it .\n",
      "But uh I think this <disfmarker> our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ?\n",
      "Or is it also for other company <disfmarker> uh for other televisions ?\n",
      "I think we have to use it also on other televisions though .\n",
      "Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions .\n",
      "They are two different things though .\n",
      "We have to choose one .\n",
      "It has to work on o uh all televisions .\n",
      "Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions .\n",
      "And I just uh have one more idea .\n",
      "But <disfmarker> Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers .\n",
      "So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it .\n",
      "Will this will this add to the cost ?\n",
      "Uh then it won't be <disfmarker> uh will have just one cover on the uh original one .\n",
      "And then you can buy the covers .\n",
      "but you have to m uh be able to change it .\n",
      "D does it make it more difficult to design ?\n",
      "I think it will be a little more difficult ,\n",
      "but not too much .\n",
      "Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones .\n",
      "Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones .\n",
      "If it won't works then we'll get something else .\n",
      "Then we uh won't g uh go further with it .\n",
      "Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ?\n",
      "Uh a p a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> a cover made in uh in China , it it won't be I guess so expensive I think .\n",
      "Yeah but there are also design cost .\n",
      "Would you change the cover ?\n",
      "I wi I won't .\n",
      "But maybe I think trendy people\n",
      "or like children where you can paint on it ,\n",
      "I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So <disfmarker>\n",
      "I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea . <vocalsound>\n",
      "but I don't think we have to do it .\n",
      "Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh <disfmarker> for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set .\n",
      "And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote .\n",
      "Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web .\n",
      "Uh message to the television .\n",
      "And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh <disfmarker> and maybe uh teletext or something like that .\n",
      "well these are two uh remotes ,\n",
      "and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more .\n",
      "Or uh uh more functions on the remote .\n",
      "Uh maybe more devices you can influence .\n",
      "Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ .\n",
      "Um any ideas about that ?\n",
      "Basic or multifunctional ?\n",
      "We'll got back on that later .\n",
      "So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go .\n",
      "Then it's your turn , the marketing expert .\n",
      "So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market ,\n",
      "Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons .\n",
      "And we looked at uh several um things .\n",
      "Uh among them design ,\n",
      "uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls .\n",
      "Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls .\n",
      "Um uh they especially found found them very ugly .\n",
      "And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it .\n",
      "Uh well they also zap a lot .\n",
      "And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons .\n",
      "So a lot of unused buttons .\n",
      "Well uh the most used button is the channel selection .\n",
      "The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant .\n",
      "Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important .\n",
      "Uh not important they found the audio ,\n",
      "uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right .\n",
      "Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings . Uh th and they also are not used very often .\n",
      "Then we have a few um graphs about the market .\n",
      "Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups .\n",
      "Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five .\n",
      "Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big .\n",
      "And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I <vocalsound> I think the younger will be most interest in it .\n",
      "Um in the <gap> we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature .\n",
      "If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it .\n",
      "Now you can clearly see young users say <gap> . I will <disfmarker> that would very nice .\n",
      "And older user think uh they will be scared of change <vocalsound> I think .\n",
      "And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it .\n",
      "Young users uh think that's an interesting idea .\n",
      "And old users not .\n",
      "Uh well we uh found out that there are two <disfmarker> several markets at which we can aim .\n",
      "Uh the first are the younger ,\n",
      "the age between sixteen and forty five .\n",
      "Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here .\n",
      "Uh the second group is the older group .\n",
      "Aged between forty six and sixty five .\n",
      "They are less interested in uh new features .\n",
      "But uh they spend their money more easily .\n",
      "Well then I come to my uh personal preferences .\n",
      "Uh yeah the first question is uh <disfmarker> also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at .\n",
      "Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it .\n",
      "What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use , remote control .\n",
      "So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested .\n",
      "But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition .\n",
      "Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control .\n",
      "You can find most functions on a T_V_ set .\n",
      "So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things .\n",
      "One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one .\n",
      "So the design of our remote control is very important .\n",
      "If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher .\n",
      "Uh I think we don't have that in our budget .\n",
      "And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something .\n",
      "So it's <disfmarker> Yeah , it's hard to uh get the younger group .\n",
      "I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition .\n",
      "So I think that can be an d good option . L_C_D_ .\n",
      "Uh we go <gap> <disfmarker> back on the decisions later .\n",
      "Now we have a few new product requirements .\n",
      "First , teletext .\n",
      "We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore .\n",
      "So not necessary .\n",
      "Only for the television .\n",
      "So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something .\n",
      "We look at the age group of forty plus .\n",
      "Uh no , younger than forty .\n",
      "Our corporate colour and slogan must be used .\n",
      "So you can see it on our site .\n",
      "Now we have to decide what controls do we need .\n",
      "Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said .\n",
      "I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option .\n",
      "Yeah but we don't use it .\n",
      "It's a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> new requirement .\n",
      "No discussion about it .\n",
      "Well a power button ?\n",
      "Uh the well um I think separate channels . So <disfmarker>\n",
      "So so uh zero to nine or something .\n",
      "Uh volume .\n",
      "To move up , move down .\n",
      "Do we make a menu ?\n",
      "Uh yes\n",
      "I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows .\n",
      "Up-down for channel selection ,\n",
      "and left-right uh for volume .\n",
      "And if you press the menu button you get into the menu ,\n",
      "On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ?\n",
      "Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control .\n",
      "Think it's better to have it on the remote control ,\n",
      "But then we come to the costs .\n",
      "But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control .\n",
      "So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell .\n",
      "Is this enough ?\n",
      "Mute .\n",
      "I think that's enough for the next phase .\n",
      "And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or <disfmarker>\n",
      "that's for the next phase .\n",
      "Phase two is the conceptual design .\n",
      "And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons .\n",
      "Your individual action , you can find them in the email .\n",
      "let's uh talk about the interface uh concept .\n",
      "Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose ,\n",
      "uh show you some samples , uh\n",
      "uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already .\n",
      "And uh my personal preferences .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off .\n",
      "the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off .\n",
      "The channels buttons , one to nine ,\n",
      "zero to nine ,\n",
      "and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine .\n",
      "Uh the volume and channel quadrants ,\n",
      "uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel .\n",
      "And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display .\n",
      "Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples .\n",
      "Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's <disfmarker> that they're all pretty uh uh high uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Large .\n",
      "A lot <disfmarker> a lot of buttons buttons .\n",
      "Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long .\n",
      "Um , power buttons are mostly at the top\n",
      "uh left or right .\n",
      "Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue .\n",
      "And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons .\n",
      "Some buttons have icons like the play and stop ,\n",
      "but we don't use that .\n",
      "But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters .\n",
      "Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ .\n",
      "So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that .\n",
      "For the uh menu , what do we use for that ?\n",
      "We don't have buttons for the menu .\n",
      "Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel <gap> .\n",
      "I thought that was our uh idea .\n",
      "And that the menu button is okay .\n",
      "Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .\n",
      "The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .\n",
      "Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting .\n",
      "But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case .\n",
      "Uh , round edges .\n",
      "The logo at the bottom .\n",
      "And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour .\n",
      "Uh , recognisable .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Not too much colours .\n",
      "Uh , no . Not too much .\n",
      "But this has to be has to be trendy\n",
      "Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion .\n",
      "Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want ,\n",
      "our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to .\n",
      "And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also .\n",
      "First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours .\n",
      "Like , totally yellow , totally red .\n",
      "Uh , the shapes are curved and round ,\n",
      "Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long .\n",
      "But to give him the shape of your hand , so you <disfmarker> it's easier to use or something like that .\n",
      "The battery , there are few options .\n",
      "Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery .\n",
      "Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice <gap> have it curved .\n",
      "And maybe like it's hand-shaped .\n",
      "Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic\n",
      "And also rubber\n",
      "Uh the push-buttons .\n",
      "We have one new thing uh discovered .\n",
      "It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse .\n",
      "Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels .\n",
      "When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up\n",
      "and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel .\n",
      "You can do it with your thumb .\n",
      "And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons\n",
      "The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips .\n",
      "There are also uh simple chips .\n",
      "They are uh cheaper .\n",
      "Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control ,\n",
      "And you have also advanced um chips .\n",
      "But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen .\n",
      "And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ ,\n",
      "And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the <disfmarker> for remote control ,\n",
      "that we then use the primary colours .\n",
      "This is with an L_C_D_ ? No ,\n",
      "Not with an L_C_D_ .\n",
      "But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons .\n",
      "But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel .\n",
      "but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty .\n",
      "but like we said before , it has to be used on every television .\n",
      "Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control .\n",
      "but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls .\n",
      "And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already .\n",
      "And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news .\n",
      "Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> I got it on my screen and it was uh higher .\n",
      "But I don't know uh how much higher . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better .\n",
      "And that might uh bring back the costs uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "I think we must discuss who <disfmarker> uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it .\n",
      "With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control .\n",
      "Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ .\n",
      "Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ .\n",
      "Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip .\n",
      "A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range .\n",
      "The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip .\n",
      "So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching .\n",
      "Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers .\n",
      "They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan .\n",
      "Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich .\n",
      "Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products .\n",
      "And um , material ? That should feel <disfmarker> have uh a spongy feeling .\n",
      "Then the old and rich .\n",
      "They like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes .\n",
      "Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences .\n",
      "We uh aim at the younger market .\n",
      "However , with trends it's always if there's <disfmarker> it's now .\n",
      "It it it might last one year , and next year it be <disfmarker> uh can be totally different .\n",
      "Well , we have to decide on the concept .\n",
      "Maybe one of you can paint it on the board .\n",
      "Can make several uh concepts .\n",
      "We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand .\n",
      "This is the remote control .\n",
      "And then you have something like th this under it .\n",
      "So , it has to be soft ?\n",
      "And it has to be soft , yeah .\n",
      "Buttons on top of it .\n",
      "The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb .\n",
      "But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here .\n",
      "If we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ?\n",
      "with the menu uh button .\n",
      "And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it .\n",
      "But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu .\n",
      "Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu .\n",
      "Yeah , but <vocalsound> again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ?\n",
      "And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher .\n",
      "we make two concepts .\n",
      "One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ .\n",
      "And and this one has to be soft .\n",
      "And this has to be harder ,\n",
      "Or some kind of rubber around it .\n",
      "And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger .\n",
      "It's not good to use .\n",
      "One with two scroll buttons and one with without .\n",
      "Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu .\n",
      "And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ .\n",
      "Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose .\n",
      "Then it depends on the cost .\n",
      "M uh yeah , maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um\n",
      "more separate , yeah .\n",
      "Like , you have the menu button in between uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "When you uh <gap> the menu , you have to go there there there there .\n",
      "I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for .\n",
      "We have two buttons missing .\n",
      "The mute button .\n",
      "Mute . And the other .\n",
      "Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle .\n",
      "But how do you wanna solve it ?\n",
      "With the switch button .\n",
      "Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy .\n",
      "Uh , then you can also have like uh th um <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yeah , and joystick , I think .\n",
      "Does that break , a joystick ?\n",
      "Or a small one just like in a laptop .\n",
      "But how expensive it is ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "For the young peoples I think scroll button's good .\n",
      "That's not expensive than uh <disfmarker> Joystick is better .\n",
      "I mean the the shape of the remote control .\n",
      "Just like a Playstation thing .\n",
      "Maybe , if it's possible , <vocalsound> it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better .\n",
      "And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ?\n",
      "they're not uh in details .\n",
      "It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it .\n",
      "Then for the components , we use a normal battery .\n",
      "Then it's <disfmarker> Ch cheapest way , I think .\n",
      "Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive .\n",
      "Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ .\n",
      "If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip .\n",
      "If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip .\n",
      "And uh , we <disfmarker> If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to\n",
      "Uh the most expensive .\n",
      "So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_\n",
      "Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ?\n",
      "If you have pistol , it <disfmarker> L_C_D_'s not easy .\n",
      "if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller .\n",
      "Now we put uh rubber around it .\n",
      "Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber .\n",
      "Then this is the design .\n",
      "And the buttons are on the next page .\n",
      "So , depends on the cost .\n",
      "Next meeting . Thirty minutes .\n",
      "You two stay here . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Check your mail .\n",
      "It has to be ready in the next meeting .\n",
      "Next meeting is called the detailed design .\n",
      "Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype .\n",
      "<vocalsound> This is it .\n",
      "It's uh it's uh it's yellow .\n",
      "And uh , this is rubber .\n",
      "And and and this too .\n",
      "the sides .\n",
      "And the rest is hard plastic .\n",
      "We had a new idea <vocalsound> that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside .\n",
      "And then it covers the <disfmarker> these buttons\n",
      "And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .\n",
      "So , you can still operate uh all the things .\n",
      "Because you don't always use the menu .\n",
      "And the buttons ?\n",
      "Big buttons .\n",
      "And everything is blue , except the power button .\n",
      "yeah , and the mute and the the other button .\n",
      "And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .\n",
      "Very obvious .\n",
      "Up is channel up .\n",
      "Down is channel down .\n",
      "To the right is volume up .\n",
      "To the left is volume down .\n",
      "Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ .\n",
      "What's the R_R_\n",
      "R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo .\n",
      "That's on the rub rubber part .\n",
      "So , what they say on the side is put fashion there .\n",
      "So , that's it . That's prototype .\n",
      "Now , the finance . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Do we change the the order ?\n",
      "Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?\n",
      "Finance is um <disfmarker>\n",
      "first uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet .\n",
      "Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together .\n",
      "I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias ,\n",
      "uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences .\n",
      "Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ?\n",
      "And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating .\n",
      "Um , well uh we have the Word document\n",
      "Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important .\n",
      "But um , if I can get a number in here .\n",
      "Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative .\n",
      "Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together .\n",
      "And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating .\n",
      "Yeah , I think it's uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh <disfmarker> it doesn't contain many new features .\n",
      "Um , I think I will give it a <disfmarker> yeah , yeah , yeah <gap> , a four .\n",
      "I think the scroll-button is something also uh new .\n",
      "I think technologically I'll give it an seven .\n",
      "So now i I think you uh see it <gap> um its statement .\n",
      "And you <gap> true or false .\n",
      "Oh , true or false .\n",
      "Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two .\n",
      "Sorry .\n",
      "It's a one . <vocalsound> The first item .\n",
      "Um , this product is for all sorts of customers .\n",
      "Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market\n",
      "and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers .\n",
      "That's uh a six .\n",
      "Mm , four .\n",
      "So I think it's four .\n",
      "I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons .\n",
      "Maybe version uh three point O_ uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> has other colours . <vocalsound>\n",
      "We put the fashion in electronics .\n",
      "Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ?\n",
      "I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design .\n",
      "Um , so I would give it a two .\n",
      "Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard .\n",
      "Uh , I say uh a five .\n",
      "It's not fashion , it's new .\n",
      "Then make it th three .\n",
      "The next element um is the product looks good .\n",
      "Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow .\n",
      "So , I would give this a five .\n",
      "I give it a one . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Well , I say three .\n",
      "Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons .\n",
      "I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better .\n",
      "Well , uh if we go to <vocalsound> uh this fashion , I <disfmarker> We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers .\n",
      "So , I would give this a two .\n",
      "Me too . One .\n",
      "It does not get lost easily .\n",
      "Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ?\n",
      "Yes . <vocalsound>\n",
      "No , we did not .\n",
      "So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ?\n",
      "Ah . Yellow .\n",
      "I don't think so .\n",
      "It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch .\n",
      "A one ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "Yeah , o one .\n",
      "Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market .\n",
      "Uh yeah , did we achieve that .\n",
      "I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two .\n",
      "There's a fancy look-and-feel .\n",
      "That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said .\n",
      "Well , let's also give this a two .\n",
      "I gave this a one because of the rubber .\n",
      "Yeah , f very fancy <gap> trendy .\n",
      "It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy .\n",
      "So I think s two is better .\n",
      "uh it goes with the latest trends .\n",
      "No , it's new .\n",
      "Innovation .\n",
      "If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables ,\n",
      "well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food\n",
      "We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that .\n",
      "We'll go for a three .\n",
      "I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round .\n",
      "But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue .\n",
      "Something what also younger people want .\n",
      "So um , come back to the presentation now .\n",
      "So , we find yourself there ,\n",
      "and now we have to calculate an average rating .\n",
      "Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , <gap> .\n",
      "Twenty one .\n",
      "So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third .\n",
      "Two .\n",
      "So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think .\n",
      "So , it's good .\n",
      "So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Next . Finance .\n",
      "So , now uh we have a product .\n",
      "But uh , is it cheap enough ?\n",
      "We have a battery .\n",
      "Cheapest there is .\n",
      "Electronics . Advanced chip .\n",
      "it's the most advanced .\n",
      "We have the simple , regular and advanced .\n",
      "We have the adva advanced .\n",
      "We have double curved .\n",
      "<gap> we have half rubber , half plastic .\n",
      "Yes , yellow .\n",
      "So , we have the L_C_D_\n",
      "We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ?\n",
      "One .\n",
      "And it's not really a s\n",
      "Joystick uh thing .\n",
      "Now , uh button supplement .\n",
      "Special colour .\n",
      "The buttons are regular colour .\n",
      "It's too expensive .\n",
      "So , we have to change something .\n",
      "Fifteen Euros .\n",
      "well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay .\n",
      "'Cause we can't lose the battery .\n",
      "We can't lose the advanced chip .\n",
      "We can't lose the double curve .\n",
      "We have rubber , special colour .\n",
      "Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour .\n",
      "Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ?\n",
      "For a remote control , I think it is . <vocalsound>\n",
      "If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right .\n",
      "Um , then we uh lose two Euros .\n",
      "Then we have thirteen Euros .\n",
      "Half a Euro too much .\n",
      "Exactly the special colours .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> just only plastic or only rubber ?\n",
      "One Euro discount .\n",
      "I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ .\n",
      "And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour <disfmarker>\n",
      "Normal colour , and the the joystick away ,\n",
      "But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ?\n",
      "Or it's then a regular ?\n",
      "The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_\n",
      "If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .\n",
      "Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television .\n",
      "And then uh we move the the colour .\n",
      "No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour .\n",
      "And you cannot use the red and green button .\n",
      "So , all the buttons has to <disfmarker> have to be the same colour .\n",
      "What's the normal colour ?\n",
      "Very good .\n",
      "Now , uh project eva evaluation .\n",
      "process . Went good .\n",
      "I think uh the creativity uh <vocalsound> was good enough .\n",
      "Uh leadership .\n",
      "Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote .\n",
      "Team-work okay .\n",
      "New ideas found . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Nope .\n",
      "I I espe I especially uh liked the the means ,\n",
      "the the SMARTboard\n",
      "Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices .\n",
      "Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation .\n",
      "Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .\n",
      "Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor <gap>\n",
      "Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly .\n",
      "Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others .\n",
      "And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking .\n",
      "I think it was good .\n",
      "Not too many discussions .\n",
      "So , it's good for the speed .\n",
      "So , I think we're ready .\n",
      "Good price .\n",
      "Evaluation ready .\n",
      "Okay , the waiting is for our Marketing Expert , Ruud .\n",
      "Is there a schedule for this meeting ?\n",
      "Yes , there is actually .\n",
      "Um I will li list the agenda for today .\n",
      "For this meeting .\n",
      "It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras .\n",
      "Um we're here to develop uh a new product .\n",
      "this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it .\n",
      "Um you are here in a specific role .\n",
      "Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert ,\n",
      "Roo is here as the User Interface Designer\n",
      "and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer .\n",
      "we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here .\n",
      "Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan ,\n",
      "uh and we will have a discussion .\n",
      "Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes ,\n",
      "Um is there any room for a little presentation ?\n",
      "Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> No problem .\n",
      "this new product we are are g are going to develop , um\n",
      "it's a remote control ,\n",
      "Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development ,\n",
      "Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design ,\n",
      "um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the <gap> <disfmarker>\n",
      "Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements ,\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> the second is the technical functional design ,\n",
      "um what effect should the remote have ?\n",
      "Um and the last one is the working design .\n",
      "How exactly does it work in the technical sense .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here .\n",
      "You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to .\n",
      "<vocalsound> to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder ,\n",
      "Um then we have this electronic white-board system .\n",
      "you can draw on the board using this pen .\n",
      "There are little um uh\n",
      "sensors ,\n",
      "it's on the um eraser now ,\n",
      "so we click the pen button .\n",
      "<vocalsound> you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button .\n",
      "Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file .\n",
      "So do not m make a new file .\n",
      "But we all use the same white-board file\n",
      "Current colour , you can choose another colour .\n",
      "Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour .\n",
      "I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder\n",
      "Um as a little training <vocalsound> um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected .\n",
      "Uh a wee rabbit .\n",
      "Um Roo , could you do the same please ?\n",
      "But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width .\n",
      "It it should be a cat .\n",
      "Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .\n",
      "the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros .\n",
      "Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros ,\n",
      "we uh we will focus this internationally ,\n",
      "And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty ,\n",
      "maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation .\n",
      "Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion ,\n",
      "I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things ,\n",
      "and the technical possibilities and impossibilities .\n",
      "So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions ,\n",
      "but uh there might be some impossibilities .\n",
      "Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available\n",
      "I have some uh initial ideas about some things\n",
      "One thing about uh interopera operability .\n",
      "Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device <disfmarker> diverse subset of equipment .\n",
      "Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment .\n",
      "Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .\n",
      "Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other .\n",
      "We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh\n",
      "is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore .\n",
      "But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth .\n",
      "Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that .\n",
      "But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so\n",
      "you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .\n",
      "but that's uh something we should discuss\n",
      "but take these things into account when you start the discussion .\n",
      "Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things .\n",
      "Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications .\n",
      "Um there are other things like um <vocalsound> how to make it trendy ,\n",
      "which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role .\n",
      "Um the way how it should be controlled by the user ,\n",
      "which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part .\n",
      "H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?\n",
      "Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said ,\n",
      "um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different\n",
      "devices ?\n",
      "I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store .\n",
      "Yes , I think it should be something like that .\n",
      "It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product ,\n",
      "right ?\n",
      "Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer ,\n",
      "Yeah , I do I don't know that .\n",
      "We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ?\n",
      "don't have the information for it .\n",
      "we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public ,\n",
      "And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?\n",
      "Or are there any o other controls ?\n",
      "Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or <disfmarker>\n",
      "I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords .\n",
      "And um it's very easy for a user to to switch <disfmarker>\n",
      "to to switch b uh between uh channels\n",
      "or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ ,\n",
      "And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing .\n",
      "Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ ,\n",
      "so you must <vocalsound> point everywhere ,\n",
      "Maybe not even pointed .\n",
      "so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that .\n",
      "So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited .\n",
      "For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ ,\n",
      "so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that ,\n",
      "but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in <disfmarker> outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um <disfmarker> <vocalsound>\n",
      "you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons ,\n",
      "so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand .\n",
      "And of course you don't always know where all buttons are ,\n",
      "so it should be visible al um <vocalsound> in dark too .\n",
      "Uh I'll write down glow in the dark .\n",
      "Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting .\n",
      "Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the <disfmarker> such a product ?\n",
      "Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ?\n",
      "Uh I think most most things have already been said ,\n",
      "like uh control multiple devices .\n",
      "And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue .\n",
      "But uh lots of devices already use infrared .\n",
      "we'll probably have to implement that .\n",
      "Um you said something about visibility in the dark .\n",
      "uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ?\n",
      "but it it can be quite simple ,\n",
      "you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it .\n",
      "The uh the the digits in black .\n",
      "Uh then it's already visible in dark .\n",
      "So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy\n",
      "<disfmarker> well , it can be for design , of course .\n",
      "because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product .\n",
      "Yes , but there's a cost limitation too .\n",
      "twelve Euro fifty , yeah .\n",
      "So that's a big problem , I think .\n",
      "I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product .\n",
      "The cost price is very low .\n",
      "The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade .\n",
      "Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it .\n",
      "Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily\n",
      "um or it should not consume too much um power .\n",
      "Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week .\n",
      "maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or <disfmarker>\n",
      "But then Bluetooth uh might be problem .\n",
      "<vocalsound> It's use uh a lot of uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "Well does it ?\n",
      "I know it from the cell phone .\n",
      "Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's <disfmarker> it seems to work uh quite okay .\n",
      "But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day .\n",
      "Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time .\n",
      "<vocalsound> so we will go back to our own uh work .\n",
      "Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes\n",
      "and um , well , you know your o your individual actions\n",
      "or your personal coach will probably email you about th it .\n",
      "See you in thirty minutes .\n",
      "Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control ,\n",
      "the new project requirements ,\n",
      "but we should not um support teletext in the remote ,\n",
      "Um the remote control should only be used for television ,\n",
      "Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty ,\n",
      "<vocalsound> then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .\n",
      "the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set .\n",
      "Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls ,\n",
      "the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion .\n",
      "And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .\n",
      "But my <disfmarker> in <gap> my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .\n",
      "And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set .\n",
      "there's a energy source here .\n",
      "The user interface connected to a chip ,\n",
      "which is connected to the sender ,\n",
      "which generates messages using uh infrared light ,\n",
      "It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared .\n",
      "And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons .\n",
      "The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed .\n",
      "So maybe we should consider that . <vocalsound>\n",
      "personally I think we should infra use infrared ,\n",
      "because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set .\n",
      "Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board ,\n",
      "And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff .\n",
      "if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy\n",
      "they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also .\n",
      "Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive ,\n",
      "I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons ,\n",
      "Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think .\n",
      "The buttons to zap are used the <disfmarker> about uh fifteen hundred times ,\n",
      "when uh the power button is only used one time .\n",
      "And the volume button's only four times .\n",
      "So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons .\n",
      "And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control .\n",
      "So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones .\n",
      "There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment .\n",
      "I'm just wondering , <vocalsound> the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> Another device is not a solution .\n",
      "maybe maybe like clapping in your hands ,\n",
      "and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound ,\n",
      "But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons . Uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ ,\n",
      "Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .\n",
      "But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something .\n",
      "I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the <disfmarker> their remote .\n",
      "the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh <gap> . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself ,\n",
      "<gap> just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility .\n",
      "But that will be very costly , I think .\n",
      "m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things .\n",
      "Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution ,\n",
      "But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated\n",
      "And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ?\n",
      "I I think so ,\n",
      "according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often .\n",
      "Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it .\n",
      "we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions\n",
      "do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple <disfmarker>\n",
      "if we um include other uh innovative functions <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh then they uh might ,\n",
      "'cause young people uh like new features .\n",
      "Maybe it's more important to make the <disfmarker> make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment ,\n",
      "I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that .\n",
      "I don't know if if it's user-friendly .\n",
      "And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button .\n",
      "draw draw it on the board .\n",
      "It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what <disfmarker> which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick .\n",
      "just a round uh button should be the trick , I think .\n",
      "We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness .\n",
      "uh <disfmarker> it's not necessary to to have a full list ,\n",
      "but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting .\n",
      "Dual channel watch .\n",
      "And and do we want um the ten digits ?\n",
      "I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits .\n",
      "But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough .\n",
      "And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people .\n",
      "But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull .\n",
      "You c <vocalsound> you can d make them very fancy\n",
      "so you can experiment by <disfmarker> uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing .\n",
      "maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control .\n",
      "when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing .\n",
      "but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly .\n",
      "Uh <disfmarker> If if we would um drop the ten digits\n",
      "but keep the programme and the volume ,\n",
      "So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries .\n",
      "There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries .\n",
      "And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem .\n",
      "it's very cheap .\n",
      "It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts .\n",
      "although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh <disfmarker> Profitable . We we <disfmarker> yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people .\n",
      "we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design .\n",
      "but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside .\n",
      "But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that <disfmarker> these kinds of things .\n",
      "<vocalsound> If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap .\n",
      "then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh <disfmarker> especially for the voice recognition .\n",
      "Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> the Interface Designer , um I would like to <disfmarker> the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept .\n",
      "User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept .\n",
      "It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um <vocalsound> um yeah , some some fancy lights .\n",
      "So we drop the voice recognition ?\n",
      "We can decide the next meeting . Yep .\n",
      "I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching .\n",
      "Yeah .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ?\n",
      "Ease of use is important ,\n",
      "but uh innovation is more important ,\n",
      "and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important .\n",
      "And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture ,\n",
      "and that they want spongy material .\n",
      "I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something .\n",
      "the corporate colours are grey and yellow .\n",
      "Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge .\n",
      "maybe it rubber\n",
      "or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .\n",
      "You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover .\n",
      "a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these .\n",
      "but they're very advanced and very high-tech and <vocalsound> just um , well , a weird um shape .\n",
      "But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow .\n",
      "And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip\n",
      "um <disfmarker> I mean this is how you hold a remote control .\n",
      "There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in ,\n",
      "in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on ,\n",
      "and still have the ease of use ,\n",
      "We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh\n",
      "<vocalsound> We have uh a curved one .\n",
      "Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape ,\n",
      "which is curved in three dimension .\n",
      "We can use plastic ,\n",
      "uh which is the same for rubber ,\n",
      "We can use wood and titanium .\n",
      "we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases .\n",
      "And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source <disfmarker> source .\n",
      "we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh <vocalsound> remote controls .\n",
      "Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply .\n",
      "I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny .\n",
      "But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and <disfmarker>\n",
      "But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy .\n",
      "but maybe <vocalsound> maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries ,\n",
      "because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power .\n",
      "And we of course have the traditional uh solar power ,\n",
      "um of course we have the push-buttons\n",
      "and uh we also have scroll-wheels .\n",
      "And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons .\n",
      "Um <vocalsound> uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays ,\n",
      "we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Yes . That is possible too . Yes .\n",
      "I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .\n",
      "Um with uh maybe a channel selector .\n",
      "What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ?\n",
      "Yeah , uh that's a possibility ,\n",
      "There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel .\n",
      "this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um <disfmarker>\n",
      "And click it to muten the device .\n",
      "So it might attract uh the young customers .\n",
      "it's it's been done years ago\n",
      "and I don't see it anywhere now .\n",
      "So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .\n",
      "Yeah , yeah . Okay .\n",
      "Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip .\n",
      "And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker ,\n",
      "Uh in the voice recognition you say a word <disfmarker> you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute .\n",
      "and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying .\n",
      "It performs the action .\n",
      "d did we already decide on the display ?\n",
      "Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "No . I don't think you need it .\n",
      "I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing ,\n",
      "but they seem to like natural uh stuff .\n",
      "Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy .\n",
      "The kinetic thing it <gap> it's it's a possibility .\n",
      "but I'm <disfmarker> I think you should combine it with batteries .\n",
      "it's maybe a bit too too flashy ,\n",
      "So it it needs to be rubber .\n",
      "the younger people liked soft material .\n",
      "But they really need the regular chip ,\n",
      "But but do we want the curved uh uh design ,\n",
      "if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull .\n",
      "And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot <disfmarker> um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels .\n",
      "So I think this is the best of two worlds .\n",
      "what about um <vocalsound> the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue .\n",
      "It's it's <disfmarker> uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device .\n",
      "<vocalsound> But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all .\n",
      "it depends on your walls actually .\n",
      "Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . Um with a with a regular chip .\n",
      "And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels .\n",
      "Yes , yes .\n",
      "And uh skip <disfmarker> and skip the L_C_D_ part .\n",
      "according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology ,\n",
      "Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it ,\n",
      "But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours .\n",
      "Uh I think our customers will go insane .\n",
      "Yeah . Okay , I I agree .\n",
      "Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product .\n",
      "I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian .\n",
      "Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .\n",
      "The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design .\n",
      "And for you , the product evaluation .\n",
      "Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .\n",
      "can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ?\n",
      "The casing is curved , single-curved .\n",
      "Traditional batteries uh and solar .\n",
      "What about uh the finishing of the case ?\n",
      "Yeah , with colourful rubber .\n",
      "Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers ,\n",
      "and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red . <gap> uh black and yellow .\n",
      "Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course ,\n",
      "It's quite modern actually .\n",
      "I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before .\n",
      "um <disfmarker> you must have a red uh on and off button .\n",
      "Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours ,\n",
      "it should be a full colour cover with such an image\n",
      "but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device .\n",
      "The scroll-heel . Yes ,\n",
      "the voice recognition we already decided .\n",
      "But there will be some additional buttons , I guess .\n",
      "because they're they're rubber too .\n",
      "What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber .\n",
      "Uh didn't <disfmarker> did we inc uh include the digi digits\n",
      "or uh leave them to the speech recognition ?\n",
      "'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button .\n",
      "So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .\n",
      "What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ?\n",
      "we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing .\n",
      "I'm I'm not so sure ,\n",
      "I have to ask with manufacturing ,\n",
      "So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber .\n",
      "Um I guess you two have to figure that out .\n",
      "We use the regular chip ?\n",
      "Regular .\n",
      "Yeah .\n",
      "Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control .\n",
      "And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions ,\n",
      "and then they will not use this dial as often .\n",
      "Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ?\n",
      "A a and the voice recognition as well ,\n",
      "it's it's it's another approach ,\n",
      "And and the case is is rubber ?\n",
      "And the buttons ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> Plastic or rubber .\n",
      "Uh yellow with uh\n",
      "grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least . <vocalsound>\n",
      "M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition .\n",
      "okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that .\n",
      "al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it <disfmarker> you'd disable it with a little beep and and <disfmarker>\n",
      "The production costs .\n",
      "Twenty two .\n",
      "And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell .\n",
      "um then I did the following changes .\n",
      "Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells ,\n",
      "um by not using the voice recognition feature ,\n",
      "th this design is not um within our price model .\n",
      "But I'm afraid it's not complete .\n",
      "So the button we can use plastic .\n",
      "And uh maybe not use the special form .\n",
      "And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber .\n",
      "<vocalsound> It becomes a very dull remote control , I know .\n",
      "But it's the board decision .\n",
      "Maybe we should look at an <disfmarker> uh focus on another uh <disfmarker>\n",
      "uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic\n",
      "but that's not what uh has been asked .\n",
      "Although I think we <disfmarker> yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people\n",
      "uh by giving it another colour already .\n",
      "Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no .\n",
      "because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good .\n",
      "Is it ? Is it fancy ?\n",
      "just <vocalsound> give it a two .\n",
      "was it innovative ?\n",
      "we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype .\n",
      "I think uh it's a two .\n",
      "Is it easy to use ?\n",
      "so it will be a two point five .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Is it easy to find ? <vocalsound>\n",
      "we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out ,\n",
      "but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .\n",
      "but I personally give it a one .\n",
      "The feel of the remote control is spongy .\n",
      "and make this a one point five .\n",
      "The remote control offers enough features .\n",
      "I'll give it uh a one . For for the <disfmarker> for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one .\n",
      "I I've <disfmarker> I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price .\n",
      "But <vocalsound> whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is <disfmarker> well , is not sure .\n",
      "Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced .\n",
      "it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .\n",
      "Um you had an overall rating . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "it's it's about one point five . Something like that .\n",
      "we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product .\n",
      "<vocalsound> The process was good .\n",
      "But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs .\n",
      "And and that was the the big deal .\n",
      "We had we had too little information actually .\n",
      "looking at room for creativity , there was w way too <disfmarker> the the choice of components was way too narrow .\n",
      "in the first meeting we we already were very creative .\n",
      "Uh leadership .\n",
      "Fantastic . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I think we're a good team .\n",
      "I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey Roo uh <gap> . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ?\n",
      "<vocalsound> Uh . The digital pen was okay ,\n",
      "but SMARTboard was really bad .\n",
      "although I would like to see um O_C_R_ .\n",
      "But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information .\n",
      "I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big .\n",
      "I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops .\n",
      "The drawing cap capabilities are very limited .\n",
      "And and uh w you were <disfmarker> when you're using uh Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , uh which you can use for drawing .\n",
      "we need to redesign uh the product .\n",
      "I think we we we all know what the redesign should be .\n",
      "A simple , dull , uh one-coloured box .\n",
      "Yes .\n",
      "I'll be your Project Manager for today , for this project .\n",
      "My name is Mark\n",
      "Um my name is Dirk , Dirk Meinfeld .\n",
      "Um I will be uh <gap> Pr Project <disfmarker> the Marketing Expert .\n",
      "Nick Broer ,\n",
      "User Interface Designer .\n",
      "My name is Xavier Juergens ,\n",
      "I'm the Industrial Designer ,\n",
      "we need design a remote control for television set ,\n",
      "which has to be original , trendy and user-friendly .\n",
      "So apparently we need to <vocalsound> um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market .\n",
      "Anyway , we'll take this project in three steps , three pha uh three phase of design .\n",
      "First step will be the functional design .\n",
      "so to help with these , you have <disfmarker> we have the SMARTboards here .\n",
      "I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board ,\n",
      "just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder ,\n",
      "I'll put the the minutes of every meeting , I'll put them there too ,\n",
      "gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot .\n",
      "So , draw us your favourite animal .\n",
      "It's supposed to be a dolphin ,\n",
      "I like the elephant .\n",
      "the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger .\n",
      "I introduce to the world the amazing ant .\n",
      "What are y What are your first ideas for the new product ?\n",
      "The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control .\n",
      "I was thinking about design remote control , with our uh motto and all .\n",
      "No rational changes or whatever , 'cause it <disfmarker> revolutionary changes ,\n",
      "so very intuitive design , I guess .\n",
      "Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ?\n",
      "but I think it's a little <gap> take it into consideration .\n",
      "is uh the the material it is made of , it should be something light .\n",
      "Selling price , twenty five Euros .\n",
      "The production price , twelve and a half Euros , approximately .\n",
      "We'll reach the uh reach that profit .\n",
      "<gap> international .\n",
      "Today , functional design phase .\n",
      "The functional requirements , it's uh <vocalsound> uh very important for uh the user ,\n",
      "seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . Um <disfmarker>\n",
      "they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control ,\n",
      "and um they use <disfmarker> yeah , they use zap a lot ,\n",
      "but um uh the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection .\n",
      "but uh w and not important in the audio settings , display settings\n",
      "we can we can hide those under a menu or something ,\n",
      "that was <gap> in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control ,\n",
      "so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it .\n",
      "And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition\n",
      "And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen\n",
      "We wanna have a little preview on the remote control . Preview what's on the channel .\n",
      "'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too .\n",
      "Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel ,\n",
      "it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example .\n",
      "some technical functions .\n",
      "There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear .\n",
      "Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while .\n",
      "And possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger\n",
      "this is basically what I h had in mind in the <disfmarker> fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound ,\n",
      "but more <disfmarker> less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons .\n",
      "Yeah , it's true .\n",
      "So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere\n",
      "so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that's cheaper .\n",
      "You have the the power coming in ,\n",
      "The switch uh uh <vocalsound> uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code ,\n",
      "then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs .\n",
      "You have infrared\n",
      "Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far ,\n",
      "except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light .\n",
      "Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore\n",
      "I don't think we should remove the button ,\n",
      "But I don't think it should be <vocalsound> very <disfmarker> it should be one of the big buttons for example .\n",
      "<vocalsound> This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people ,\n",
      "um the younger people were defined under forty .\n",
      "<disfmarker> And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable ,\n",
      "which is apparently <vocalsound> black and yellow ,\n",
      "With that concept I started thinking , so why not just steal Nokia's idea\n",
      "and just make changeable covers for your <disfmarker>\n",
      "I think this is a good idea .\n",
      "I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen ,\n",
      "Y Yes , I think so too .\n",
      "I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power .\n",
      "What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview ,\n",
      "For example , a little T_V_ guide .\n",
      "I'm not sure it's even possible ,\n",
      "I have to check that out ,\n",
      "I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement ,\n",
      "just make a button on your T_V_\n",
      "we should go for that .\n",
      "then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not ,\n",
      "because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do .\n",
      "I think it's universal . I think we should go for universal ,\n",
      "Speech recognition , I think it's very hard ,\n",
      "because we're selling across multiple countries .\n",
      "Besides that , the technology isn't really super yet ,\n",
      "but it's just not <disfmarker> I don't think the market's ripe for that yet .\n",
      "you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable .\n",
      "maybe a little harder plastic\n",
      "If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area .\n",
      "But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves\n",
      "it's not even a bad idea .\n",
      "For example , if your buttons are faded , after <disfmarker> I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover .\n",
      "Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve .\n",
      "it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example ,\n",
      "something I have to look into .\n",
      "you have to come up with a components concept ,\n",
      "you should do some trend-watching ,\n",
      "I think it should be <disfmarker> have less or l very little buttons\n",
      "and maybe a second <vocalsound> second level menu for the advanced things .\n",
      "Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu ,\n",
      "Is it techni technically possible to uh <vocalsound> send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu ,\n",
      "because we're working with different types of television ,\n",
      "That is true .\n",
      "I don't think so .\n",
      "A double-sided remote control ?\n",
      "I don't think that's useful .\n",
      "but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s .\n",
      "because usually the the menu is <disfmarker> the menu button is is usable between different brands . Especially the big ones , the big brands ,\n",
      "if you can put some research into that , if it's possible .\n",
      "I think it's possible ,\n",
      "I thi I think so too .\n",
      "Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever .\n",
      "And uh with different colours uh .\n",
      "I'll put some on paper\n",
      "and present them next time uh the ideas that I have .\n",
      "we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example .\n",
      "I think that the <vocalsound> the buttons should be <disfmarker> the channel buttons should be <vocalsound> uh on their own .\n",
      "and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume <disfmarker>\n",
      "Think it's like this . <vocalsound>\n",
      "Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle .\n",
      "Yeah , in the middle .\n",
      "Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you <disfmarker> if it's lost , for people that are deaf .\n",
      "but for example if it's lost in your armchair , we'll not see the flash .\n",
      "We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you <disfmarker> that some light lights up .\n",
      "We could do that .\n",
      "uh the power button somewhere over here ?\n",
      "I usually press it on top .\n",
      "Mute .\n",
      "I think it should be at the bottom somewhere .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Around uh not uh not at top at the <disfmarker> around the volume selection .\n",
      "Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ?\n",
      "I'm not sure y <vocalsound> I'm not sure it's <disfmarker> if it's expensive ,\n",
      "but just take a look at it ,\n",
      "to have uh like sort of a <disfmarker> maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it .\n",
      "But I think that will cost a lot .\n",
      "Uh a normal wire would be better .\n",
      "I'm not sure if it costs a lot ,\n",
      "And do people actually want that ? To pay extra <disfmarker> they want to pay for rechargeable ?\n",
      "we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it ,\n",
      "we have to <disfmarker> either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station .\n",
      "I think this is a brilliant product .\n",
      "because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers ,\n",
      "Could you post some <vocalsound> other essentials of what people want ,\n",
      "Where would we want the uh teletext button ?\n",
      "Do we put it somewhere over here ?\n",
      "Or maybe this is something for the next meeting ,\n",
      "draw us up some some designs of of possible <disfmarker>\n",
      "just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big ,\n",
      "we don't want <gap> we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot .\n",
      "because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus .\n",
      "but that's what we stick under the menu button .\n",
      "Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu .\n",
      "If it isn't , then we cannot reach it .\n",
      "But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu .\n",
      "Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ?\n",
      "If you rule out functions , then uh <disfmarker> and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it .\n",
      "Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition .\n",
      "Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen .\n",
      "Yeah , just look at the possibilities then ,\n",
      "we should do a little thing about design ,\n",
      "because it looks boring really to me .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Different colours maybe .\n",
      "And the design , it should differ .\n",
      "let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing .\n",
      "Let's take take the basic design again , what we <disfmarker> oh , crap <disfmarker> uh came up with .\n",
      "If you're reading from top to bottom , I think it's better to put it uh at the top .\n",
      "How can you use an L_C_D_ screen ?\n",
      "But nee the function of it . <vocalsound>\n",
      "I <disfmarker> I'm not sure .\n",
      "So we have three people saying it should be on top .\n",
      "Do we put the volume control and the channel control here ,\n",
      "In the middle .\n",
      "Maybe in a circle for example , like we <disfmarker> like in this example .\n",
      "but we do agree that we <vocalsound> keep this at the centre ,\n",
      "I think the channel button should be in the centre .\n",
      "but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen , that means a lot of space that we need .\n",
      "But it has to be a little bit heavier .\n",
      "Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space .\n",
      "uh let's give this uh a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars .\n",
      "Yeah , let's think of a name , okay .\n",
      "the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly ,\n",
      "Yeah .\n",
      "Detailed design <disfmarker>\n",
      "Prototype presentation , well first\n",
      "It's basically what we agreed upon ,\n",
      "but just a little bit more specified .\n",
      "<vocalsound> Basically in <gap> <disfmarker> what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components ,\n",
      "We chose a different type of colour for the menu . A bit darker yellow\n",
      "And it <disfmarker> I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber\n",
      "So we have it's a bit round shaped ,\n",
      "We chose the buttons to be uh teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute .\n",
      "We have battery power ,\n",
      "we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . The sample sensor and uh <disfmarker> for speak recognition anyway .\n",
      "we have sin one curve , <vocalsound> a design . Rubber design .\n",
      "And we had a special colour . Suppose yellow is a special colour .\n",
      "<disfmarker> You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display .\n",
      "You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost ,\n",
      "What do we scrap .\n",
      "think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition .\n",
      "Because the L_C_D_ has more support on customer side .\n",
      "Uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample ,\n",
      "so I had to take out the special colour I suppose .\n",
      "and if you want it <disfmarker> if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers .\n",
      "So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen ?\n",
      "uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half ,\n",
      "we could take out the curve .\n",
      "I think the colour is more important than the really the curve ,\n",
      "but the example is because we do offer the um <vocalsound> the possibility of adding your own custom covers .\n",
      "Can we then not also uh change the material ?\n",
      "We take plastic for the basic cover\n",
      "something that's stuck into my mind is that <disfmarker> something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of <disfmarker> the spongy feeling of the <disfmarker>\n",
      "We can put those to the to the other covers .\n",
      "Rubber would increase durability\n",
      "so why why uh <vocalsound> do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ?\n",
      "and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company\n",
      "But we can take a risk .\n",
      "that's not our decision to take .\n",
      "I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect\n",
      "and keep the functionality between <disfmarker> of <disfmarker> within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget .\n",
      "but the one that g has given us the order to design this .\n",
      "and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know . It is an <disfmarker> still an option , but <vocalsound> not for this price .\n",
      "yeah , it's true .\n",
      "So that's what we gotta go with .\n",
      "just to get it through final ,\n",
      "I say lose the curve . Oh that's true ,\n",
      "Which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary .\n",
      "I second that .\n",
      "So we keep the curve .\n",
      "And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber ,\n",
      "because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has .\n",
      "Yeah . I would say <disfmarker> I would agree with you on the colour ,\n",
      "we're final on that .\n",
      "we could just discuss how the project went .\n",
      "I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time .\n",
      "Me too , I felt a bit blind throughout the project ,\n",
      "because it's good .\n",
      "I mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price ,\n",
      "let's eval evaluate uh the product of us , our design .\n",
      "I uh will pre present uh some statements\n",
      "and we will decided together wha what <disfmarker> if it's true or false\n",
      "So so the buttons , the look and feel .\n",
      "One and a half . <vocalsound>\n",
      "And the next one <vocalsound> uh <disfmarker> yeah , when it's lost uh you can find it .\n",
      "so I think it <disfmarker> that's <disfmarker> that deserves a one . Definitely .\n",
      "And the next one .\n",
      "Manual .\n",
      "I think the L_C_D_ display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control ,\n",
      "it it is pretty straight-forward .\n",
      "So I might make this a two instead of a one , I guess .\n",
      "You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way .\n",
      "What are we uh displaying on the L_C_D_ screen ?\n",
      "Things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu ,\n",
      "I thought that people wanted previews on their <disfmarker>\n",
      "I don't think it's possible really .\n",
      "uh with configuring your remote control for favourite <disfmarker> your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that .\n",
      "So that could be done by L_C_D_ display .\n",
      "A three .\n",
      "I mean the shape is trendy .\n",
      "The the sh the the functions are trendy .\n",
      "It's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model .\n",
      "Maybe we should go with a two then ,\n",
      "Overall score .\n",
      "Two and two thirds .\n",
      "mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition .\n",
      "'Cause yeah , that gives you a seven ,\n",
      "I do admit that we d <vocalsound> did miss a little <disfmarker> or didn't sp didn't talk <gap> <disfmarker> talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display .\n",
      "We could have used it more efficiently ,\n",
      "<gap> <disfmarker> like I said , <vocalsound> changing channels , everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything .\n",
      "For example , I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created .\n",
      "I think we did pretty well as team-work though .\n",
      "Because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime ,\n",
      "There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them .\n",
      "I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool .\n",
      "I think uh s especially for design issues , it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little <disfmarker> it's easier to share them .\n",
      "Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher ,\n",
      "The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that .\n",
      "So we cannot work on more than one page at same time . That's not possible .\n",
      "The one thing we missed though , we don't have a product name .\n",
      "And it's especially on the triple R_ that's important . The Real Reaction Remote .\n",
      "Triple R_ it is .\n",
      "have to write my report now , I guess .\n",
      "Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report ?\n",
      "Yeah , sure .\n"
